<h2 class="p4">PREFACE.</h2>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span></p>

<p>The occupation of California by the people
of the United States, and the discovery of its
rich gold mines, form a new era in the history
of the world. According to present appearances,
these events forebode a complete revolution
in monetary and commercial affairs. The
receipts of gold from California have already
produced a sensible effect on the financial affairs
of our country; and far-seeing people predict
an entirely new state of things with respect
to the relative value of money and property.</p>

<p>Still more important effects are anticipated
from the establishment of a new, rich, and enterprising
State of the American Union on the
shores of the Pacific. Railroads across the continent
will soon transport the rich products of
Eastern Asia, by a quick transit, to the Atlantic
cities and to Europe; and a passage to
China or India, which was formerly a serious
undertaking, will become a pleasant excursion.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span></p>

<p>To gratify the public curiosity with respect
to the history and present state of this new
member of the Union, is the purpose of this
volume. In preparing it, the author has
passed rapidly over the early history, and
dwelt chiefly on recent events, and the actual
state of the country, as he considered that, by
this course, utility would be more effectually
consulted.</p>

<p>In the Appendix he has introduced the constitution
of California, and some official documents,
whose importance demanded their preservation
in a permanent form.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p class="center p2">
GEOGRAPHICAL OUTLINE OF CALIFORNIA</p>

<p class="p2">The territory called California is that part of North
America situated on the Pacific Ocean, and extending
from the 42° of north latitude southwardly to 22° 48',
and from 107° longitude, west from Greenwich, to
124°. It is bounded on the north by Oregon territory,
east by territories belonging to the United
States and the Gulf of California, and on the south
and west by Mexico and the Pacific Ocean. California
is naturally divided into two portions; the peninsula,
called Lower California, and the territory extending
northward from the peninsula, on the Pacific
Ocean, called Upper California. The line of division
between Upper and Lower California runs nearly
along the 32d parallel of latitude, westward from the
head of the Gulf of California.</p>

<p>The peninsula of California is about one hundred
and thirty miles in breadth, where it joins the continent.
It extends south-eastwardly, generally diminishing
in breadth, till it terminates in two points.
The point farthest south-west is called Cape San
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
Lucas. The other, sixty miles east by north of San
Lucas, is called Cape Palmo. The peninsula is about
seven hundred miles long.</p>

<p>Upper California extends, upon the Pacific, from
the 32d parallel of latitude, northward to the 42d
parallel, a distance of about seven hundred miles. It
is separated from Oregon by a range of highlands,
called the Snowy Mountains, or, by the Spaniards,
the Sierra Nevada. The eastern limit of Upper California
is rather uncertain. By some it is considered
as including the region watered by the Colorado River,
while others limit it by the great mountain range that
extends along the western side of the continent.</p>

<p>The Californian peninsula seems to be a prolongation
of the great western chain of mountains. It
consists entirely of high, stony ridges, separated by
sandy valleys, and contains very few tracts of level
ground. In a general view, it might be termed an
irreclaimable desert. The scarcity of rain and the
small number of springs of water, with the intense
heat of the sun's rays, uninterrupted in their passage,
render the surface of the country almost destitute of
vegetation. Yet in the small oases formed by the
passage of a rivulet through a sandy defile, where
irrigation is possible, the ground may be made to produce
all the fruits of tropical climes, of the finest
quality, and in great quantity. The southern portion
of the peninsula contains several gold mines, which
have been worked, though not to any great extent.
On the Pacific side, the coast offers many excellent
harbors, but the lack of fresh water near them proves
an obstacle in the way of their occupation. The
principal harbors are the Bay of la Magdalena,
separated from the ocean by the long island of Santa
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
Margarita, the Bay of Sebastian Vizcaino, east of the
Isle of Cedaro, Port San Bartolomé, sometimes called
Turtle Bay, and Port San Quintin, a good harbor,
with fresh water in the vicinity, and called by the
Spanish navigators the Port of the Eleven Thousand
Virgins.</p>

<p>The great westernmost range of mountains runs
northward from the peninsula, nearly parallel with
the Pacific coast, to the 34th parallel of latitude, below
which is Mount San Bernardin, one of the highest
peaks in California, about forty miles from the ocean.
Farther northward, the space between the mountains
and the coast becomes wider, and, in a few places,
reaches eighty miles. The intermediate region is traversed
by lines of hills, or smaller mountains joined
with the great range. The most considerable of the
inferior ridges extends from Mount San Bernardin
to the south side of the entrance of the Bay of San
Francisco, where it is called the San Bruno Mountains.
Between this range and the coast runs the
Santa Barbara range, terminating at the Cape of
Pines, on the south-west side of the Bay of Monterey.
Bordering on the Bay of San Francisco, on the east
side, is the Bolbona ridge. Beyond these are lines of
highlands which stretch from the great chain and terminate
in capes on the Pacific.</p>

<p>There are many streams among the valleys of
Upper California, some of which, in the rainy season,
swell to a considerable size. But no river, except the
Sacramento, falling into the Bay of San Francisco, is
known to flow through the maritime range of mountains,
from the interior to the Pacific. The valleys
thus watered offer abundant pasturage for cattle.</p>

<p>The principal harbors of Upper California are those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
offered by the Bays of San Francisco, Monterey,
San Pedro, Santa Barbara, and San Diego. The
Bay of San Francisco is one of the finest harbors in
the world. The combined fleets of all the naval
powers of Europe might there find safe shelter. It
is surrounded by ranges of high hills, and joins the
Pacific by a passage two miles wide and three in
length. The other harbors can only be frequented in
the fine season, and afford a very insecure shelter for
vessels. San Diego is the farthest south. The bay
at that place runs ten miles eastward into the land,
and is separated from the ocean by a ridge of sand.
Proceeding northward, about seventy miles, the Bay
of San Pedro is next met. It is open to the south-west
winds, but sheltered from the north-west. About
a hundred miles north-west of San Pedro, is the harbor
of Santa Barbara. It is an open roadstead sheltered
from the north and west winds, but exposed to
the violence of the south-westerly storms, which prevail
during the greater part of the year. A hundred
miles farther north is the Bay of Monterey. It is
extensive, and lies in an indentation of the coast,
somewhat semicircular. The southernmost portion is
separated from the ocean by the point of land ending
at the Cape of Pines. In the cove thus formed,
stands the town of Monterey, for some time the capital
of California. The harbor affords but a poor shelter
from storms.</p>

<p>The Sacramento and San Joachim are the principal
rivers of California, but the Sacramento alone is
navigable to any extent worthy of mention. There
are numerous small streams and lakes in the interior,
the principal outlet of which is the Colorado River.
The valleys through which these streams flow are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
fertile, and afford good pasture for cattle; but the
remainder of the region between the maritime and
the Colorado ranges of mountains is a barren waste
of sand.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class="center p2">DISCOVERY OF CALIFORNIA.</p>

<p class="p2">The first exploration of the Pacific coasts of North
America was made by the Spaniards, in the sixteenth
century. After Hernando Cortes had completed the
conquest of Mexico, he commenced exploring the adjoining
seas and countries; no doubt, with the hope
of discovering lands richer than those which he had
conquered, and which would afford new fields for the
exercise of his daring enterprise and undaunted perseverance.
He employed vessels in surveying the
coasts of the Mexican Gulf, and of the Atlantic more
northerly. Vessels were built upon the Pacific coast
for like purposes, two of which as early as 1526,
were sent to the East Indies.</p>

<p>The first expedition of the Spaniards, sent along
the western coast of Mexico, was conducted by Pedro
Nunez de Maldonado, an officer under Cortes. He
sailed from the mouth of the Zacatula River, in July,
1528, and was six months engaged in surveying the
shores from his starting-place to the mouth of the
Santiago River, a hundred leagues farther north-west.
The territory he visited was then called Xalisco, and
inhabited by fierce tribes of men who had never been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
conquered by the Mexicans. Flattering accounts of
the fertility of the country and of the abundance of
the precious metals in it were brought back by the expedition,
and these served to excite the attention of
the Spaniards. When the expedition returned Cortes
was in Spain, whither he had gone to have his title
and powers more clearly defined. He returned in
1530 with full power to make discoveries and conquests
upon the western coast of Mexico. From the
opposition of his enemies, he was prevented from fitting
out an expedition before 1532. The most northern
post upon the Pacific coast, occupied by the
Spaniards, was Aguatlan, beyond which the coast was
little known.</p>

<p>The expedition sent by Cortes to the north-western
coast of Mexico was commanded by his kinsman, Diego
Hurtado de Mendoza. It sailed from Tehuantepec
in July, 1532, and consisted of two vessels; one commanded
by Diego Hurtado de Mendoza in person, and
the other by Juan de Mazuela. Mendoza proceeded
slowly along the shore of the continent as far as the
27° of latitude, where, his crew being mutinous, he
sent back one of his vessels with the greater part of
his men, and continued the voyage with the remaining
vessel. Vague reports were afterwards received that
Mendoza's vessel was thrown ashore somewhere to the
northward, and that all on board had perished. The
vessel which was sent back, was stranded near the
mouth of the River Vanderas, and after the murder
of the greater part of the crew, she was plundered
by Nuno de Guzman, Governor of Xalisco. About
the middle of the next year, Cortes received the news
of the return of the vessel which Mendoza had sent
back, and he immediately despatched two ships under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
the command of Hernando Grijalva and Diego Becerra,
in search of the other. These ships sailed on
the 30th of September, 1533, but were soon separated.
Grijalva discovered the islands of St. Thomas,
as he called them&mdash;a group of islands about fifty
leagues from the coast. He remained there till the
following spring, and then returned home. Becerra
proceeded north-westward; but his crew mutinied,
and he was murdered by Fortuno Ximenes. The
mutineers, under Ximenes, then steered directly west
from the main land, and soon reached a coast not
known to them before. They landed, and soon after
Ximenes and nineteen men were killed by the natives.
The rest of the men carried the vessel over
to Xalisco, where she was seized by Nuno de Guzman.</p>

<p>Soon after these unlucky expeditions, Nuno de
Guzman sent out several exploring parties in a northerly
direction, one of which traced the western shore
as far as the mouth of the Colorado, and brought back
accounts of a rich and populous country and splendid
cities in the interior. When Cortes became acquainted
with the seizure of his vessels, a dispute arose between
him and Nuno de Guzman, which almost led to
a battle between their forces. But no action occurred,
and Cortes, having heard of the newly discovered
country, which was said to abound in the finest
pearls, embarked at Chiametla, with a portion of his
men, and set sail for the new land of promise. On
the 3d of May, 1535, the day of the Invention of the
Holy Cross, according to the Roman Catholic Calendar,
Cortes arrived in the bay where Ximenes and
his fellow-mutineers had met their fate in the previous
year. In honor of the day, the place was called
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
Santa Cruz, and possession of it was taken in the
name of the Spanish sovereign.</p>

<p>The country claimed by Cortes for Spain, was the
south-east portion of the peninsula, which was afterwards
called California. The bay, called by Cortes,
Santa Cruz, was, perhaps, the same now known as
Port La Paz, about a hundred miles from the Pacific,
near the 24th parallel of latitude. Cortes landed on
the shore of this bay, rocky and forbidding as it appeared,
with a hundred and thirty men, and forty
horses. He then sent back two of his ships to Chiametla,
to bring over the rest of his troops. The vessels
soon returned with a portion of the troops, and
being again despatched to the Mexican coast, only
one of them returned. The other was wrecked on her
way. Cortes then took seventy men and embarked
for Xalisco, from which he returned just in time to
save his troops from death by famine. A year was
spent in these operations, and the troops began to
grow discontented. A few pearls had been found on
the coast, but the country was found to be barren,
and without attractions for Spaniards.</p>

<p>In the mean time, the wife of Cortes hearing reports
of his ill success, sent a vessel to Santa Cruz, and entreated
him to return. He then learned that he had
been superseded in the government of New Spain by
Don Antonio de Mendoza, who had already entered the
capital as viceroy. Cortes returned to Mexico, and
soon after, recalled the vessels and troops from Santa
Cruz.</p>

<p>The viceroy, Mendoza, had received some information
concerning the country north-west of Mexico,
from de Cabeza-Vaca and two other Spaniards, who
had wandered nine years, through forests and deserts,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
from Tampa Bay, Florida, until they reached Culiacan.
They had received from the natives, accounts
of rich and populous countries situated to the north-west.
Mendoza, wishing to ascertain the truth of the
reports, sent two friars, according to the advice of
Las Casas, to make an exploration. They were accompanied
by a Moor who had crossed the continent
with Cabeza-Vaca and his friends, and they set out
from Culiacan on the 7th of March, 1539.</p>

<p>Soon after the departure of the friars, Cortes sent
out his last expedition. It was commanded by Francisco
de Ulloa, and consisted of three vessels, well
equipped. Sailing from Acapulco, on the 8th of July
1539, Ulloa reached the Bay of Santa Cruz, after
losing one of his vessels in a storm. From Santa
Cruz he started to survey the coast towards the north-west.
He completely examined both shores of the
Gulf of California, and discovered the fact of the
connection of the peninsula with the main land, near
the 32° of latitude. This gulf Ulloa named the Sea
of Cortes. On the 18th of October, he returned to
Santa Cruz, and on the 29th again sailed with the
object of exploring the coasts farther west. He
rounded the point now called Cape San Lucas, the
southern extremity of California, and sailed along the
coast towards the north. The Spaniards proceeded
slowly, as they were opposed by north-western storms,
and often landed and fought with the natives. In
January, 1540, Ulloa reached the island under the
28th parallel of latitude, near the coast, which they
named the Isle of Cedars. There he remained till
April, when one of the ships, bearing the sick and
accounts of the discoveries, was sent back to Mexico.
The returning vessel was seized at Santiago by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
officers of the viceroy. The fate of the remaining
vessel is uncertain. Some of the writers of that day
asserting that he continued his voyage as far north as
the 30° of latitude, and returned safely to Mexico;
while one asserts that nothing more was heard of him
after the return of the vessel he sent back.</p>

<p>In the mean time, the two friars and the Moor
penetrated a considerable distance into the interior of
the continent, and sent home glowing accounts of rich
and delightful countries which they said they had discovered.
The inhabitants had, at first, been hostile,
and had killed the Moor; but in the end submitted to
the authority of the King of Spain. Mendoza, believing
the accounts of the friars to be strictly true,
prepared an expedition for the conquest of the countries
they described. Disputes with the different
Spanish chieftains occupied some months, at the end
of which Cortes returned to Spain, in disgust. Mendoza
despatched two bodies of troops, one by land,
the other by sea, to reconnoitre the newly discovered
land, and clear the way for conquest. The marine
expedition was undertaken by two ships, under the
command of Fernando de Alarcon, who sailed from
Santiago on the 9th of May, 1540, and proceeding
north-west along the coast, he reached the head of the
California Gulf, in August of the same year. There
he discovered the river now called the Colorado.
The stream was ascended to the distance of eighty
leagues, by Alarcon and some of his men, in boats;
but all their inquiries were unsatisfactorily answered,
and it was determined to return to Mexico. The vessels
returned safely before the end of the year.</p>

<p>The land forces sent, at the same time, to the north-west,
were composed of infantry and cavalry, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
commanded by Francisco Vasquez de Coronado, who
had been appointed governor of New Gallicia, in place
of Nuno de Guzman. The party left Culiacan on the
22d of April, 1540, and took their way north, following
the course described by the friars. They found
the route which had been represented as easy, almost
impassable. They made their way over mountains,
and deserts, and rivers, and, in July, they reached the
country called Cibola by the natives, but found it a
half cultivated region, thinly inhabited by a people
destitute of the wealth and civilization they had been
represented as possessing. What had been represented
as seven great cities, were seven small towns, rudely
built. A few turquoises and some gold and silver
supposed to be good, constituted the amount of what
had been termed immense quantities of jewels, gold
and silver. The Spaniards took possession of the
country and wanted to remain and settle there. But
Vasquez refused to acquiesce; and after naming one
of the towns he visited, Granada, he started for the
north-west, in search of other countries. The region
called Cibola by the inhabitants, which Vasquez
visited, is the territory now called Sonora, and is
situated about the head waters of the Rivers Yaqui
and Gila, east of the upper portion of the Gulf of
California. The movements of the Spaniards after
leaving Cibola, in August, 1540, have been the subject
of very vague and contradictory accounts. All that
is certain is, that the greater part of the force soon
returned to Mexico, and that Vasquez, with the
remainder, wandered through the interior for nearly
two years longer, when, being disappointed in his
expectations, he returned to Mexico in 1542.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1542, two vessels were placed under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
the command of Juan Roderiguez Cabrillo, a Portuguese
navigator of great reputation. The two vessels
sailed from Navidad, a small port in Xalisco, in June,
1542. They rounded Cape San Lucas, and proceeded
north-west, along the coast, as far as the 88th degree
of latitude, when he was driven back, and took refuge
in a harbor of one of the San Barbara islands. There
Cabrillo died and the command devolved on Bartolome
Ferrelo. Ferrelo was a zealous and determined
man, and he resolved to proceed with the expedition.
He sailed towards the north, and on the 26th of
February, reached a promontory near the 41st parallel
of latitude, which he named Stormy Cape. On the
1st of March, the ships reached the 44th parallel, but
they were again driven south; and the men being
almost worn out, Ferrelo resolved to go back to Mexico.
He arrived at Navidad on the 14th of April, 1543.
The promontory called Stormy Cape by Ferrelo, was
the most northern portion of California visited by that
navigator, and it is probably the same which is now
called Cape Mendocino.</p>

<p>From all accounts that they had been able to collect,
the Spaniards concluded that neither rich and populous
countries existed beneath the 40th parallel of
latitude, nor was there any navigable passage between
the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans to be found in the
same region. They, therefore, ceased to explore the
north-western territory for some time after the return
of Ferrelo in 1543.</p>

<p>Having thus given a somewhat detailed account of
the discovery and explorations of the territory now
called California, it will be sufficient to merely mention
the various expeditions that visited it prior to the first
regular settlement. In the spring of 1579, California
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
was visited by Sir Francis Drake, the English navigator,
who landed on the shores of a bay supposed to be
that of San Francisco. He formally took possession
of the country in the name of Queen Elizabeth, and
called it New Albion. He left California on the 22d
of July, 1579. In the spring of 1596, Sebastian
Viscaino, under orders from the viceroy of Mexico,
attempted to plant colonies on the peninsula of California,
but the country was soon abandoned on account
of the barrenness of the soil and the ferocity of the
natives. Viscaino visited the coast of Upper California
in 1602, and discovered and named some of the
places Cabrillo had discovered and named long before.
The Port San Miguel of Cabrillo was named Port San
Diego; Cape Galera was named Cape Conception,
the name now borne by it; the Port of Pines was
named Port Monterey. This was the last expedition
made by the Spaniards along the coast of California
for more than a hundred and sixty years.</p>

<p>Various attempts were made to establish colonies,
garrisons, and fishing or trading ports, on the eastern
side of the peninsula of California, during the seventeenth
century, but all failed, either from the want of
funds, the sterility of the country, or the hostility of
the natives. The pearl fishery in the gulf was the
principal bait that attracted the Spaniards, and they
succeeded in obtaining a considerable quantity, some
of which were very valuable.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span></p>

<hr class="l15" />
<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class="center p2">
FROM THE FIRST SETTLEMENT TO THE REVOLUTION
IN MEXICO.</p>

<p class="p2">The first establishment of the Spaniards in California,
was made by the Jesuits, in November, 1697.
The settlement was called Loreto, and founded on
the eastern side of the peninsula, about two hundred
miles from the Pacific. On entering California, the
Jesuits encountered the same obstacles which had
before prevented a settlement of the country. The
land was so sterile, that it scarcely yielded sustenance
to the most industrious tiller, and as the settlements
were all located near the sea, fishing was the resource
of the settlers to make up the deficiency of food. The
natives continued hostile, and killed several of the
Jesuit fathers. By perseverance and kindness, the
Jesuits overcame all the obstacles with which they met,
and within sixty years after their entrance into California,
they had established sixteen missions, extending
along the eastern side of the peninsula, from Cape
San Lucas to the head of the gulf. Each of these
establishments consisted of a church, a fort, garrisoned
by a few soldiers, and some stores and dwelling-houses,
all under the control of the resident Jesuit father.
Each of the missions formed the centre of a district
containing several villages of converted Indians. None
of the Jesuits visited the western coast of the peninsula
except on one occasion, in 1716.</p>

<p>Great exertions were made by the settlers to acquire
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
a knowledge of the geography, natural history and
languages of the peninsula, and they appear to have
been generally successful. The result of their researches
were published in Madrid, in 1757, and the
work was entitled a "History of California." They
surveyed the whole coast of the Gulf of California,
and, in 1709, Father Kuhn, one of the Jesuit fathers,
ascertained beyond doubt the connection of the peninsula
with the continent, which had been denied for a
century. But all the labors of the Jesuits were brought
to an end in 1767. In that year, Charles III. of
Spain, issued a decree, banishing members of that
order from the Spanish territories; and a strong
military force, under command of Don Gasper de
Portola, was despatched to California, and soon put
an end to the rule of the Jesuits by tearing them from
their converts.</p>

<p>The Spanish government did not intend to abandon
California. The peninsula immediately became a
province of Mexico, and was provided with a civil and
military government, subordinate to the viceroy of
that country. The mission fell under the rule of the
Dominicans, and from their mode of treatment, most
of the converts soon returned to their former state of
barbarism. The Spaniards soon formed establishments
on the western side of the peninsula. In the spring
of 1769, a number of settlers, with some soldiers and
Franciscan friars, marched through the peninsula towards
San Diego. They reached the bay of San Diego
after a toilsome journey, and the settlement on the
shore of the bay was begun in the middle of May,
1769. An attempt was made, soon after, to establish
a colony at Port Monterey; but the party under
Portola that went in search of the place, passed further
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
on to the bay of San Francisco, and could not retrace
their steps before the cold weather set in, and they
then returned to San Diego. The people left at San
Diego had been several times attacked by the natives,
and after the return of Portola's party they almost
perished for want of food. But a supply arrived on
the very day upon which they had agreed to abandon
the place and return to Mexico. Portola again set
out for Monterey, and there effected a settlement.
Parties of emigrants from Mexico came to the western
shore of California during the year 1770, and establishments
were made on the coast between San Diego and
Monterey. The multiplication of their cattle, independent
of the fruits of agricultural labor, before 1775,
made the settlers of Upper California able to resist
the perils to which their situation exposed them.</p>

<p>In order to give efficiency to the operations on the
western coast of North America, the Spanish government
selected the port of San Blas, in Mexico, at the
entrance of the Gulf of California, for the establishment
of arsenals, ship-yards and warehouses, and
made it the centre of all operations undertaken in that
quarter. A marine department was created for the
special purpose of advancing the interests of the
Spaniards in the settlement of the western shore of
California. By the energy displayed in managing
this department the Spaniards succeeded in making
eight establishments on the Pacific coast between the
California peninsula and Cape Mendocino, before
1779. The most southern post was San Diego, and
the most northern, San Francisco, on the great bay
of the same name. The establishments were almost
entirely military and missionary, the object of the
Spaniards being solely the occupation of the country.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
The missions were under the control of the Franciscans,
who, unlike the Jesuits, took little care to exert
themselves in procuring information concerning the
country in which they were established.</p>

<p>Various expeditions for exploring the coast of Upper
California above Cape Mendocino, were made by the
Spaniards. One of these proceeded as far north as
the latitude of 41 degrees, and some men were landed
on the shores of a small bay, just beyond Cape Mendocino,
and gave the harbor the name of Port Trinidad.
The small river which flows into the Pacific near the
place where they landed was called Pigeon River, from
the great number of those birds in the neighborhood
of it. The Indians appeared to be a peaceable and
industrious race, and conducted themselves towards
the Spaniards in the most inoffensive manner. In
the same year, 1775, Bodega, a Spanish commander,
returning from a voyage extended as far north as the
58th degree of latitude, discovered a small bay which
had not previously been described, and he accordingly
gave it his own name, which it still retains. This Bay
of Bodega is situated a little north of the 38th degree
of latitude.</p>

<p>Few events worth recording occurred in California,
during the whole period of fifty years, from the first
establishment of the Spaniards on the western coast till
the termination of the Mexican war of independence.
An attempt of the Russians to form a settlement on the
shores of the Bay of Bodega, in 1815, was met with a
remonstrance from the governor of California. The
remonstrance of the governor was disregarded, and
his commands to quit the place disobeyed. The Russian
agent, Kushof, denied the right of the Spaniards
to the territory, and the governor being unable to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
enforce his commands, the intruders kept possession
of the ground until 1840, when they left of their
own accord.</p>

<hr class="l15" />
<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class="center p2">
FROM THE REVOLUTION TILL THE WAR BETWEEN THE
UNITED STATES AND MEXICO.</p>

<p class="p2">Before the commencement of the struggle for independence
in Mexico, the missions in California were,
to some extent, fostered by the Spanish government,
and supplies were sent to them regularly. But when
the war began, the remittances were reduced, and the
establishments soon began to decay. After the overthrow
of the Spanish rule, in 1822, the territory of
California was divided into two portions. The peninsula
was then called Lower California, and the whole
of the continental territory called Upper California.
When the Mexicans adopted a constitution, in 1824,
each of these territories became entitled to send one
representative to the National Congress. At the
same time, the adult Indians who could be considered
civilized, were declared citizens of the republic, and
had lands given to them. This, of course, freed them
from submission to the missionaries, who, thus deprived
of their authority, either returned to Spain or Mexico,
or took refuge in other lands. The Indians being
free from restraint, soon sank to a low depth of barbarism
and vice.</p>

<p>Immediately after the overthrow of the Spanish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
authorities, the ports of California began to be the
resort of foreigners, principally whalers and traders
from the United States. The trade in which they
engaged, that of exchanging manufactured goods for
the provisions, hide and tallow furnished by the
natives, was at first irregular, but as it increased, it
became more systematic, and mercantile houses were
established in the principal ports. The Mexican
government became dissatisfied with this state of
things, and ordered the governor of Upper California
to enforce the laws which prohibited foreigners from
entering or residing in the territories of Mexico without
a special permission from the authorities. Accordingly,
in 1828, a number of American citizens were
seized at San Diego, and kept in confinement until
1830. In that year, an insurrection broke out,
headed by General Solis, and the captured Americans
were of some assistance in suppressing it, and, in consideration
of their services, they were permitted to
leave the territory.</p>

<p>The Mexican government strove to prevent the
evils expected to flow from the presence of numbers
of foreigners in California, by establishing colonies of
their own citizens in the territory. A number of
persons were sent out from Mexico, to settle on the
lands of the missions, but they never reached their
destination. The administration which originated the
scheme was overthrown, and the new authorities
ordered the settlers to be driven back to Mexico. In
1836, the federal system was abolished by the Mexican
government, and a new constitution adopted,
which destroyed all state rights, and established a
central power. This was strenuously resisted in California.
The people rose, and drove the Mexican
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
officers from the country, declaring that they would
remain independent until the federal constitution was
restored. The general government issued strong proclamations
against the Californians, and sent an expedition
to re-establish its authority. But General
Urrea, by whom the expedition was commanded,
declared in favor of the federalists, and the inhabitants
governed themselves until July, 1837, when they
swore allegiance to the new constitution.</p>

<p>Things went on quietly in California until 1842.
In that year, Commodore Jones, while cruising in the
Pacific, received information which led him to believe
that Mexico had declared war against the United
States. He determined to strike a blow at the supposed
enemy, and, accordingly, he appeared before
Monterey, on the 19th of October, 1842, with the
frigate United States and the sloop-of-war Cyane.
He demanded the surrender of all the castles, posts,
and military places, on penalty, if refused, of the visitation
of the horrors of war. The people were astonished.
A council decided that no defence could be
made, and every thing was surrendered at once to the
unexpected Americans. The flag of the United States
was hoisted, and the commodore issued a proclamation
to the Californians, inviting them to submit to the
government of the United States, which would protect
them in the exercise of their rights. The proclamation
was scarcely issued, before the commodore
became aware of the peaceable relations existing
between the United States and Mexico, and he accordingly
restored the possession of Monterey to the
authorities, and retired with his forces to his ships,
just twenty-four hours after the surrender. This
affair irritated the inhabitants considerably, and, no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
doubt, tended to increase the ill-feeling before existing
between Mexico and the people of the United
States.</p>

<hr class="l15" />
<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p class="center p2">
FROM THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE WAR TILL ITS CLOSE.</p>

<p class="p2">War was declared by Mexico against the United
States, in May, 1846. The same month, orders were
transmitted to Commodore Sloat, commanding the
Pacific squadron, instructing him to protect the
interests of the citizens of the United States near his
station, and to employ his forces to the best advantage
in operations directed against the Mexican territory
on the Pacific. The fleet under Commodore Sloat
was the largest the Americans ever sent to that quarter,
and the men were anxious to commence active
operations. Soon after receiving his first orders, the
commodore was again instructed to take and keep
possession of Upper California; or, at least, of the
principal ports.</p>

<p>On the 8th of June, Commodore Sloat left Mazatlan,
in the flag-ship Savannah, and on the 2d of July,
reached Monterey, in Upper California. There he
found the Cyane and Levant, and learned that the
Portsmouth was at San Francisco, as previously
arranged. On the morning of the 7th, Captain Mervine
was sent to demand the surrender of Monterey.
The Mexican commandant replied that he was not
authorized to surrender the place, but referred Commodore
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
Sloat to the commanding-general of California.
A force of two hundred and fifty marines and seamen
was immediately landed, under Captain Mervine,
and they marched to the custom-house. There they
hoisted the American flag amid cheers and a salute of
twenty-one guns. The proclamation of Commodore
Sloat was then read and posted about the town.</p>

<p>After taking possession of Monterey, Commodore
Sloat despatched a courier to the commanding-general
of California, summoning him to surrender every thing
under his control in the country, and assuring him of
protection if he should comply. The general refused,
and said he would defend the country as long as he
could reckon on a single person to join his cause. A
summons to surrender was also sent to the governor
of Santa Barbara, but no answer was returned.
Orders were despatched to Commander Montgomery,
in the Portsmouth, at San Francisco, directing him to
take possession of the Bay of San Francisco, and
hoist the flag of the United States at Yerba Buena.</p>

<p>On the 9th of July, the day after the receipt of his
orders, Montgomery landed at Yerba Buena with
seventy seamen and marines, and hoisted the American
flag in the public square, amid the cheers of the
people. A proclamation was then posted to the flag
staff, and Montgomery addressed the people. The
greater part of the seamen and marines then returned
to the ship, leaving Lieutenant H. B. Watson with a
small guard, formally installed as military occupant
of the post. Thirty-two of the male residents of
Yerba Buena were enrolled as a volunteer corps,
choosing their own officers. Lieutenant Missroon was
despatched with a small party of these volunteers to
reconnoitre the Presidio and fort. He returned the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
same day, and reported that the Presidio had been
abandoned, and that the fort, seven miles from the
town, was dilapidated and mounted only a few old
pieces of cannon. The flag of the United States had
been displayed from its ramparts. On the 11th,
Montgomery informed Commodore Sloat that the flag
of the United States was then flying at Yerba Buena,
Sutter's Fort, on the Sacramento, Bodega, on the
coast, and Sonoma. The inhabitants of these places
appeared to be satisfied with the protection afforded
them by the Americans.</p>

<p>On the 13th of July, Commodore Sloat sent a flag
to the foreigners of the pueblo of San Jose, about
seventy miles from Monterey, in the interior, and
appointed a justice of the peace in place of the alcaldes.
On the 15th, Commodore Stockton arrived at Monterey,
in the frigate Congress; and Commodore Sloat
being in bad health, the command devolved upon
Stockton, and Sloat returned home. The operations
of Commodore Stockton, from the 23d of July to the
28th of August, 1846, have been rapidly sketched by
himself in his despatches to the secretary of the navy.
From these we condense a short account.</p>

<p>On the 23d of July, the commodore organized the
"California Battalion of Mounted Riflemen." Captain
Fremont was appointed major, and Lieutenant Gillespie
captain of the battalion. The next day, they
were embarked on board the sloop-of-war Cyane,
Commander Dupont, and sailed from Monterey for
San Diego, in order to land south of the Mexican
force, consisting of 500 men, under General Castro,
well fortified at a place three miles from the city. A
few days afterwards, Commodore Stockton sailed in
the Congress for San Pedro, thirty miles from Monterey,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
and having landed, marched for the Mexican
camp. When he arrived within twelve miles of the
Mexicans, they fled in small parties, in different directions.
Most of the principal officers were afterwards
taken, but the mounted riflemen not getting up in
time, most of the men escaped. On the 13th of
August, Commodore Stockton being joined by eighty
riflemen, under Major Fremont, entered the capital
of California, Ciudad de los Angeles, or the
"City of the Angels." Thus, in less than a month
after Stockton's assuming command, the American
flag was flying from every commanding position
in California, conquered by three hundred and sixty
men, mostly sailors.</p>

<p>The form of government established in California,
after the conquest, was as follows: The executive
power was vested in a governor, holding office for four
years unless sooner removed by the President of the
United States. The governor was to reside in the
territory, be commander-in-chief of the army thereof,
perform all the duties of a superintendent of Indian
affairs, have a pardoning and reprieving power, commission
all persons appointed to office under the laws
of said territory, and approve all laws passed by the
legislature before they took effect. There was the
office of the Secretary of the Territory established,
whose principal duty was to preserve all the laws and
proceedings of the legislative council, and all the acts
and proceedings of the governor. The legislative
power was vested in the governor and a council of
seven persons, who were to be appointed by the governor
at first, and hold their office for two years; afterwards
they were to be elected by the people. All the laws
of Mexico, and the municipal officers existing in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
territory before the conquest, were continued until
altered by the governor and council.</p>

<p>On the 15th of August, 1846, Commodore Stockton
adopted a tariff of duties on all goods imported from
foreign parts, of fifteen per cent. ad valorem, and a
tonnage duty of fifty cents per ton on all foreign vessels.
On the 15th of September, when the elections
were held, Walter Colton, the chaplain of the frigate
Congress, was elected Alcalde of Monterey. In the
mean time, a newspaper called the "Californian," had
been established by Messrs. Colton and Semple. This
was the first newspaper issued in California.</p>

<p>Early in September, Commodore Stockton withdrew
his forces from Los Angeles, and proceeded with his
squadron to San Francisco. Scarcely had he arrived
when he received intelligence that all the country
below Monterey was in arms and the Mexican flag
again hoisted. The Californians invested the "City
of the Angels," on the 23d of September. That
place was guarded by thirty riflemen under Captain
Gillespie, and the Californians investing it numbered
300. Finding himself overpowered, Captain Gillespie
capitulated on the 30th, and thence retired with all
the foreigners aboard of a sloop-of-war, and sailed for
Monterey. Lieutenant Talbot, who commanded only
nine men at Santa Barbara, refused to surrender, and
marched out with his men, arms in hand. The frigate
Savannah was sent to relieve Los Angeles, but she
did not arrive till after the above events had occurred.
Her crew, numbering 320 men, landed at San Pedro
and marched to meet the Californians. About half
way between San Pedro and Los Angeles, about
fifteen miles from their ship, the sailors found the
enemy drawn up on a plain. The Californians were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
mounted on fine horses, and with artillery, had every
advantage. The sailors were forced to retreat with a
loss of five killed and six wounded.</p>

<p>Commodore Stockton came down in the Congress
to San Pedro, and then marched for the "City of the
Angels," the men dragging six of the ship's guns. At
the Rancho Sepulvida, a large force of the Californians
was posted. Commodore Stockton sent one hundred
men forward to receive the fire of the enemy and then
fall back upon the main body without returning it. The
main body was formed in a triangle, with the guns
hid by the men. By the retreat of the advance party,
the enemy were decoyed close to the main force, when
the wings were extended and a deadly fire opened
upon the astonished Californians. More than a
hundred were killed, the same number wounded, and their
whole force routed. About a hundred prisoners were
taken, many of whom were at the time on parole and
had signed an obligation not to take up arms during
the war.</p>

<p>Commodore Stockton soon mounted his men and
prepared for operations on shore. Skirmishes followed,
and were continually occurring until January, 1847,
when a decisive action occurred. General Kearny
had arrived in California, after a long and painful
march overland, and his co-operation was of great
service to Stockton. The Americans left San Diego
on the 29th of December, to march to Los Angeles.
The Californians determined to meet them on their
route, and decide the fate of the country in a general
battle. The American force amounted to six hundred
men, and was composed of detachments from the ships
Congress, Savannah, Portsmouth and Cyane, aided
by General Kearny, with sixty men on foot, from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
first regiment of United States dragoons, and Captain
Gillespie with sixty mounted riflemen. The troops
marched one hundred and ten miles in ten days, and,
on the 8th of January, they found the Californians in
a strong position on the high bank of the San Gabriel
river, with six hundred mounted men and four pieces
of artillery, prepared to dispute the passage of the
river. The Americans waded through the water,
dragging their guns with them, exposed to a galling
fire from the enemy, without returning a shot. When
they reached the opposite shore, the Californians
charged upon them, but were driven back. They
then charged up the bank and succeeded in driving
the Californians from their post. Stockton, with his
force, continued his march, and the next day, in crossing
the plains of Mesa, the enemy made another
attempt to save their capital. They were concealed
with their artillery in a ravine, until the Americans
came within gun-shot, when they opened a brisk fire
upon their right flank, and at the same time charged
both their front and rear. But the guns of the Californians
were soon silenced, and the charge repelled.
The Californians then fled, and the next morning the
Americans entered Los Angeles without opposition.
The loss of the Americans in killed and wounded did
not exceed twenty, while that of their opponents
reached between seventy and eighty.</p>

<p>These two battles decided the contest in California.
General Flores, governor and commandant-general of
the Californians, as he styled himself, immediately
after the Americans entered Los Angeles, made his
escape and his troops dispersed. The territory became
again tranquil, and the civil government was
soon in operation again in the places where it had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
been interrupted by the revolt. Commodore Stockton
and General Kearny having a misunderstanding
about their respective powers, Colonel Fremont
exercised the duties of governor and commander-in-chief
of California, declining to obey the orders of
General Kearny.</p>

<p>The account of the adventures and skirmishes with
which the small force of United States troops under
General Kearny met, while on their march to San
Diego, in Upper California, is one of the most interesting
to which the contest gave birth. The party,
which consisted of one hundred men when it started
from Santa Fé, reached Warner's rancho, the frontier
settlement in California, on the Sonoma route,
on the 2d of December, 1846. They continued their
march, and on the 5th were met by a small party of
volunteers, under Captain Gillespie, sent out by Commodore
Stockton to meet them, and inform them of
the revolt of the Californians. The party encamped
for the night at Stokes's rancho, about forty miles
from San Diego. Information was received that
an armed party of Californians was at San Pasqual,
three leagues from Stokes's rancho. A party
of dragoons was sent out to reconnoitre, and they returned
by two o'clock on the morning of the 6th.
Their information determined General Kearny to
attack the Californians before daylight, and arrangements
were accordingly made. Captain Johnson was
given the command of an advance party of twelve
dragoons, mounted upon the best horses in possession
of the party. Then followed fifty dragoons, under
Captain Moore, mounted mostly on the tired mules
they had ridden from Santa Fé&mdash;a distance of 1050
miles. Next came about twenty volunteers, under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
Captain Gibson. Then followed two mountain howitzers,
with dragoons to manage them, under charge of
Lieutenant Davidson. The remainder of the dragoons
and volunteers were placed under command of Major
Swords, with orders to follow on the trail with the
baggage.</p>

<p>As the day of December 6th dawned, the enemy at
San Pasqual were seen to be already in the saddle,
and Captain Johnson, with his advance guard, made a
furious charge upon them; he being supported by the
dragoons, the Californians at length gave way. They
had kept up a continual fire from the first appearance
of the dragoons, and had done considerable execution.
Captain Johnson was shot dead in his first charge.
The enemy were pursued by Captain Moore and his
dragoons, and they retreated about half a mile, when
seeing an interval between the small advance party
of Captain Moore and the main force coming to his
support, they rallied their whole force, and charged
with their lances. For five minutes they held the
ground, doing considerable execution, until the arrival
of the rest of the American party, when they broke
and fled. The troops of Kearny lost two captains,
a lieutenant, two sergeants, two corporals, and twelve
privates. Among the wounded were General Kearny,
Lieutenant Warner, Captains Gillespie and Gibson,
one sergeant, one bugleman, and nine privates. The
Californians carried off all their wounded and dead
except six.</p>

<p>On the 7th the march was resumed, and, near San
Bernardo, Kearny's advance encountered and defeated
a small party of the Californians who had taken post
on a hill. At San Bernardo, the troops remained till
the morning of the 11th, when they were joined by a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
party of sailors and marines, under Lieutenant Gray.
They then proceeded upon their march, and on the
12th, arrived at San Diego; having thus completed a
march of eleven hundred miles through an enemy's
country, with but one hundred men. The force of
General Kearny having joined that of Commodore
Stockton, the expedition against Los Angeles, of
which we have given an account in this chapter, was
successfully consummated, and tranquillity restored in
California. General Kearny and Commodore Stockton
returned to the United States in January, 1847,
leaving Colonel Fremont to exercise the office of
governor and military commandant of California. No
further events of an importance worth recording occurred
till the treaty of peace between the United States
and Mexico.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<p class="center p2">
DISCOVERY OF THE GOLD PLACERS.</p>

<p class="p2">By the treaty concluded between the United States
and Mexico, in 1847, the territory of Upper California
became the property of the United States. Little
thought the Mexican government of the value of the
land they were ceding, further than its commercial
importance; and, doubtless, little thought the buyers
of the territory, that its soil was pregnant with a
wealth untold, and that its rivers flowed over golden
beds.</p>

<p>This territory, now belonging to the American
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
Union, embraces an area of 448,961 square miles. It
extends along the Pacific coast, from about the thirty-second
parallel of north latitude, a distance of near
seven hundred miles, to the forty-second parallel, the
southern boundary of Oregon. On the east, it is
bounded by New Mexico. During the long period
which transpired between its discovery and its cession
to the United States, this vast tract of country was
frequently visited by men of science, from all parts
of the world. Repeated examinations were made by
learned and enterprising officers and civilians; but
none of them discovered the important fact, that the
mountain torrents of the Sierra Nevada were constantly
pouring down their golden sands into the
valleys of the Sacramento and San Joaquin. The
glittering particles twinkled beneath their feet, in the
ravines which they explored, or glistened in the watercourses
which they forded, yet they passed them by
unheeded. Not a legend or tradition was heard
among the white settlers, or the aborigines, that
attracted their curiosity. A nation's ransom lay
within their grasp, but, strange to say, it escaped their
notice&mdash;it flashed and sparkled all in vain.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>The Russian American Company had a large
establishment at Ross and Bodega, ninety miles north
of San Francisco, founded in the year 1812; and
factories were also established in the territory by the
Hudson Bay Company. Their agents and <i>employes</i>
ransacked the whole country west of the Sierra
Nevada, or Snowy Mountain, in search of game. In
1838, Captain Sutter, formerly an officer in the Swiss
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
Guards of Charles X., King of France, emigrated
from the state of Missouri to Upper California, and
obtained from the Mexican government a conditional
grant of thirty leagues square of land, bounded on the
west by the Sacramento river. Having purchased
the stock, arms, and ammunition of the Russian
establishment, he erected a dwelling and fortification
on the left bank of the Sacramento, about fifty miles
from its mouth, and near what was termed, in allusion
to the new settlers, the American Fork. This formed
the nucleus of a thriving settlement, to which Captain
Sutter gave the name of New Helvetia. It is situated
at the head of navigation for vessels on the Sacramento,
in latitude 38° 33' 45" north, and longitude
121° 20' 05" west. During a residence of ten years
in the immediate vicinity of the recently discovered
<i>placéras</i>, or gold regions, Captain Sutter was neither
the wiser nor the richer for the brilliant treasures
that lay scattered around him.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>In the year 1841, careful examinations of the Bay
of San Francisco, and of the Sacramento River and
its tributaries, were made by Lieutenant Wilkes, the
commander of the Exploring Expedition; and a party
under Lieutenant Emmons, of the navy, proceeded up
the valley of the Willamette, crossed the intervening
highlands, and descended the Sacramento. In 1843-4,
similar examinations were made by Captain, afterwards
Lieutenant-Colonel Fremont, of the Topographical
Engineers, and in 1846, by Major Emory, of
the same corps. None of these officers made any
discoveries of minerals, although they were led to
conjecture, as private individuals who had visited the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
country had done, from its volcanic formation and
peculiar geological features, that they might be found
to exist in considerable quantities.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>As is often the case, chance at length accomplished
what science had failed to do. In the winter of
1847-8, a Mr. Marshall commenced the construction
of a saw-mill for Captain Sutter, on the north branch
of the American Fork, and about fifty miles above
New Helvetia, in a region abounding with pine timber.
The dam and race were completed, but on attempting
to put the mill in motion, it was ascertained that the
tail-race was too narrow to permit the water to escape
with perfect freedom. A strong current was then
passed in, to wash it wider and deeper, by which a
large bed of mud and gravel was thrown up at the
foot of the race. Some days after this occurrence,
Mr. Marshall observed a number of brilliant particles
on this deposit of mud, which attracted his attention.
On examining them, he became satisfied that they
were gold, and communicated the fact to Captain
Sutter. It was agreed between them, that the circumstance
should not be made public for the present;
but, like the secret of Midas, it could not be concealed.
The Mormon emigrants, of whom Mr. Marshall was
one, were soon made acquainted with the discovery,
and in a few weeks all California was agitated with
the startling information.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span></p>

<p>Business of every kind was neglected, and the
ripened grain was left in the fields unharvested.
Nearly the whole population of Upper California became
infected with the mania, and flocked to the
mines. Whalers and merchant vessels entering the
ports were abandoned by their crews, and the American
soldiers and sailors deserted in scores. Upon the
disbandment of Colonel Stevenson's regiment, most
of the men made their way to the mineral regions.
Within three months after the discovery, it was computed
that there were near four thousand persons,
including Indians, who were mostly employed by the
whites, engaged in washing for gold. Various modes
were adopted to separate the metal from the sand and
gravel&mdash;some making use of tin pans, others of close-woven
Indian baskets, and others still, of a rude
machine called the cradle, six or eight feet long, and
mounted on rockers, with a coarse grate, or sieve, at
one end, but open at the other. The washings were
mainly confined to the low wet grounds, and the margins
of the streams&mdash;the earth being rarely disturbed
more than eighteen inches below the surface. The
value of the gold dust obtained by each man, per day,
is said to have ranged from ten to fifty dollars, and
sometimes even to have far exceeded that. The natural
consequence of this state of things was, that the
price of labor, and, indeed, of every thing, rose immediately
from ten to twenty fold.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>As may readily be conjectured, every stream and
ravine in the valley of the Sacramento was soon explored.
Gold was found on every one of its tributaries;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
but the richest earth was discovered near the
<i>Rio de los Plumas</i>, or Feather River,<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and its branches,
the Yuba and Bear rivers, and on Weber's creek, a
tributary of the American Fork. Explorations were
also made in the valley of the San Joaquin, which
resulted in the discovery of gold on the Cosumnes
and other streams, and in the ravines of the Coast
Range, west of the valley, as far down as Ciudad de
los Angeles.</p>

<p>In addition to the gold mines, other important discoveries
were made in Upper California. A rich vein
of quicksilver was opened at New Almaden, near Santa
Clara, which, with imperfect machinery,&mdash;the heat by
which the metal is made to exude from the rock being
applied by a very rude process,&mdash;yielded over thirty
per cent. This mine&mdash;one of the principal advantages
to be derived from which will be, that the working
of the silver mines scattered through the territory
must now become profitable&mdash;is superior to those
of Almaden, in Old Spain, and second only to
those of Idria, near Trieste, the richest in the
world.</p>

<p>Lead mines were likewise discovered in the neighborhood
of Sonoma, and vast beds of iron ore near
the American Fork, yielding from eighty-five to ninety
per cent. Copper, platina, tin, sulphur, zinc, and
cobalt, were discovered every where; coal was found
to exist in large quantities in the Cascade range of
Oregon, of which the Sierra Nevada is a continuation;
and in the vicinity of all this mineral wealth, there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
are immense quarries of marble and granite, for
building purposes.</p>

<p>Colonel Mason had succeeded Colonel Fremont in
the post of governor of California and military commandant.
A regiment of New York troops, under
the command of Colonel Stevenson, had been ordered
to California before the conclusion of the treaty of
peace, and formed the principal part of the military
force in the territory.</p>

<p>Colonel Mason expressed the opinion, in his official
despatch, that "there is more gold in the country
drained by the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers,
than will pay the cost of the [late] war with Mexico
a hundred times over." Should this even prove to be
an exaggeration, there can be little reason to doubt,
when we take into consideration all the mineral resources
of the country, that the territory of California
is by far the richest acquisition made by this government
since its organization.</p>

<p>The appearance of the mines, at the period of
Governor Mason's visit, three months after the discovery,
he thus graphically describes:</p>

<p>"At the urgent solicitation of many gentlemen, I
delayed there [at Sutter's Fort] to participate in the
first public celebration of our national anniversary at
that fort, but on the 5th resumed the journey, and
proceeded twenty-five miles up the American Fork to
a point on it now known as the Lower Mines, or Mormon
Diggins. The hill-sides were thickly strewn with
canvas tents and bush arbors; a store was erected,
and several boarding shanties in operation. The day
was intensely hot, yet about two hundred men were
at work in the full glare of the sun, washing for gold&mdash;some
with tin pans, some with close-woven Indian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
baskets, but the greater part had a rude machine,
known as the cradle. This is on rockers, six or eight
feet long, open at the foot, and at its head has a coarse
grate, or sieve; the bottom is rounded, with small
cleats nailed across. Four men are required to work
this machine; one digs the ground in the bank close
by the stream; another carries it to the cradle and
empties it on the grate; a third gives a violent rocking
motion to the machine; while a fourth dashes on
water from the stream itself.</p>

<p>"The sieve keeps the coarse stones from entering
the cradle, the current of water washes off the earthy
matter, and the gravel is gradually carried out at the
foot of the machine, leaving the gold mixed with a
heavy, fine black sand above the first cleats. The
sand and gold, mixed together, are then drawn off
through auger holes into a pan below, are dried in the
sun, and afterward separated by blowing off the sand.
A party of four men thus employed at the lower
mines, averaged $100 a day. The Indians, and those
who have nothing but pans or willow baskets, gradually
wash out the earth and separate the gravel by
hand, leaving nothing but the gold mixed with sand,
which is separated in the manner before described.
The gold in the lower mines is in fine bright scales,
of which I send several specimens.</p>

<p>"From the mill [where the gold was first discovered],
Mr. Marshall guided me up the mountain on the
opposite or north bank of the south fork, where, in
the bed of small streams or ravines, now dry, a great
deal of coarse gold has been found. I there saw
several parties at work, all of whom were doing very
well; a great many specimens were shown me, some
as heavy as four or five ounces in weight, and I send
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
three pieces, labeled No. 5, presented by a Mr. Spence.
You will perceive that some of the specimens accompanying
this, hold mechanically pieces of quartz; that
the surface is rough, and evidently moulded in the
crevice of a rock. This gold cannot have been carried
far by water, but must have remained near where
it was first deposited from the rock that once bound
it. I inquired of many people if they had encountered
the metal in its matrix, but in every instance they
said they had not; but that the gold was invariably
mixed with washed gravel, or lodged in the crevices
of other rocks. All bore testimony that they had
found gold in greater or less quantities in the numerous
small gullies or ravines that occur in that mountainous
region.</p>

<p>"On the 7th of July I left the mill, and crossed to
a stream emptying into the American Fork, three or
four miles below the saw-mill. I struck this stream
(now known as Weber's creek) at the washings of
Sunol and Co. They had about thirty Indians employed,
whom they payed in merchandise. They were
getting gold of a character similar to that found in
the main fork, and doubtless in sufficient quantities to
satisfy them. I send you a small specimen, presented
by this company, of their gold. From this point, we
proceeded up the stream about eight miles, where we
found a great many people and Indians&mdash;some engaged
in the bed of the stream, and others in the small side
valleys that put into it. These latter are exceedingly
rich, and two ounces were considered an ordinary yield
for a day's work. A small gutter not more than a
hundred yards long, by four feet wide and two or three
feet deep, was pointed out to me as the one where two
men&mdash;William Daly and Parry McCoon&mdash;had, a short
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
time before, obtained $17,000 worth of gold. Captain
Weber informed me that he knew that these two men
had employed four white men and about a hundred
Indians, and that, at the end of one week's work, they
paid off their party, and had left $10,000 worth of
this gold. Another small ravine was shown me, from
which had been taken upward of $12,000 worth of
gold. Hundreds of similar ravines, to all appearances,
are as yet untouched. I could not have credited these
reports, had I not seen, in the abundance of the precious
metal, evidence of their truth.</p>

<p>"Mr. Neligh, an agent of Commodore Stockton,
had been at work about three weeks in the neighborhood,
and showed me, in bags and bottles, over $2000
worth of gold; and Mr. Lyman, a gentleman of education,
and worthy of every credit, said he had been
engaged, with four others, with a machine, on the
American Fork, just below Sutter's mill; that they
worked eight days, and that his share was at the rate
of fifty dollars a day; but hearing that others were
doing better at Weber's place, they had removed there,
and were then on the point of resuming operations. I
might tell of hundreds of similar instances; but, to
illustrate how plentiful the gold was in the pockets of
common laborers, I will mention a single occurrence
which took place in my presence when I was at
Weber's store. This store was nothing but an arbor
of bushes, under which he had exposed for sale goods
and groceries suited to his customers. A man came
in, picked up a box of Seidlitz powders, and asked the
price. Captain Weber told him it was not for sale.
The man offered an ounce of gold, but Captain Weber
told him it only cost fifty cents, and he did not wish
to sell it. The man then offered an ounce and a half,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
when Captain Weber <i>had</i> to take it. The prices of
all things are high, and yet Indians, who before hardly
knew what a breech cloth was, can now afford to buy
the most gaudy dresses.</p>

<p>"The country on either side of Weber's creek is
much broken up by hills, and is intersected in every
direction by small streams or ravines, which contain
more or less gold. Those that have been worked are
barely scratched; and although thousands of ounces
have been carried away, I do not consider that a serious
impression has been made upon the whole. Every
day was developing new and richer deposits; and the
only impression seemed to be, that the metal would be
found in such abundance as seriously to depreciate in
value.</p>

<p>"On the 8th of July, I returned to the lower mines,
and on the following day to Sutter's, where, on the
19th, I was making preparations for a visit to the
Feather, Yuba, and Bear Rivers, when I received a
letter from Commander A. R. Long, United States
Navy, who had just arrived at San Francisco from
Mazatlan with a crew for the sloop-of-war Warren,
with orders to take that vessel to the squadron at La
Paz. Captain Long wrote to me that the Mexican
Congress had adjourned without ratifying the treaty
of peace, that he had letters from Commodore Jones,
and that his orders were to sail with the Warren on or
before the 20th of July. In consequence of these, I
determined to return to Monterey, and accordingly
arrived here on the 17th of July. Before leaving
Sutter's, I satisfied myself that gold existed in the bed
of the Feather River, in the Yuba and Bear, and in
many of the smaller streams that lie between the
latter and the American Fork; also, that it had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
found in the Cosumnes to the south of the American
Fork. In each of these streams the gold is found in
small scales, whereas in the intervening mountains it
occurs in coarser lumps.</p>

<p>"Mr. Sinclair, whose rancho is three miles above
Sutter's, on the north side of the American, employs
about fifty Indians on the north fork, not far from its
junction with the main stream. He had been engaged
about five weeks when I saw him, and up to that time
his Indians had used simply closely woven willow
baskets. His net proceeds (which I saw) were about
$16,000 worth of gold. He showed me the proceeds
of his last week's work&mdash;fourteen pounds avoirdupois
of clean-washed gold.</p>

<p>"The principal store at Sutter's Fort, that of
Brannan and Co., had received in payment for goods
$36,000 (worth of this gold) from the 1st of May to
the 10th of July. Other merchants had also made
extensive sales. Large quantities of goods were daily
sent forward to the mines, as the Indians, heretofore
so poor and degraded, have suddenly become consumers
of the luxuries of life. I before mentioned
that the greater part of the farmers and rancheros
had abandoned their fields to go to the mines. This
is not the case with Captain Sutter, who was carefully
gathering his wheat, estimated at 40,000 bushels.
Flour is already worth at Sutter's thirty-six dollars a
barrel, and soon will be fifty. Unless large quantities
of breadstuffs reach the country, much suffering will
occur; but as each man is now able to pay a large
price, it is believed the merchants will bring from Chili
and Oregon a plentiful supply for the coming winter.</p>

<p>"The most moderate estimate I could obtain from
men acquainted with the subject, was, that upward of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
four thousand men were working in the gold district,
of whom more than one-half were Indians; and that
from $30,000 to $50,000 worth of gold, if not more,
was daily obtained. The entire gold district, with
very few exceptions of grants made some years ago
by the Mexican authorities, is on land belonging to
the United States. It was a matter of serious reflection
with me, how I could secure to the government
certain rents or fees for the privilege of procuring
this gold; but upon considering the large extent of
country, the character of the people engaged, and the
small scattered force at my command, I resolved not
to interfere, but to permit all to work freely, unless
broils and crimes should call for interference. I was
surprised to hear that crime of any kind was very unfrequent,
and that no thefts or robberies had been
committed in the gold district.</p>

<p>"All live in tents, in bush arbors, or in the open air;
and men have frequently about their persons thousands
of dollars worth of this gold, and it was to me a matter
of surprise that so peaceful and quiet state of
things should continue to exist. Conflicting claims to
particular spots of ground may cause collisions, but
they will be rare, as the extent of country is so great,
and the gold so abundant, that for the present there
is room enough for all. Still the government is entitled
to rents for this land, and immediate steps should be
devised to collect them, for the longer it is delayed
the more difficult it will become. One plan I would
suggest is, to send out from the United States surveyors
with high salaries, bound to serve specified periods.</p>

<p>"The discovery of these vast deposits of gold has
entirely changed the character of Upper California.
Its people, before engaged in cultivating their small
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
patches of ground, and guarding their herds of cattle
and horses, have all gone to the mines, or are on their
way thither. Laborers of every trade have left their
work benches, and tradesmen their shops. Sailors
desert their ships as fast as they arrive on the coast,
and several vessels have gone to sea with hardly
enough hands to spread a sail. Two or three are now
at anchor in San Francisco with no crew on board.
Many desertions, too, have taken place from the garrisons
within the influence of these mines; twenty-six
soldiers have deserted from the post of Sonoma,
twenty-four from that of San Francisco, and twenty-four
from Monterey. For a few days the evil appeared
so threatening, that great danger existed that the garrisons
would leave in a body; and I refer you to my
orders of the 25th of July, to show the steps adopted
to meet this contingency. I shall spare no exertions
to apprehend and punish deserters, but I believe no
time in the history of our country has presented such
temptations to desert as now exist in California.</p>

<p>"The danger of apprehension is small, and the
prospect of high wages certain; pay and bounties are
trifles, as laboring men at the mines can now earn in
one day more than double a soldier's pay and allowances
for a month, and even the pay of a lieutenant
or captain cannot hire a servant. A carpenter or
mechanic would not listen to an offer of less than
fifteen or twenty dollars a day. Could any combination
of affairs try a man's fidelity more than this? I
really think some extraordinary mark of favor should
be given to those soldiers who remain faithful to their
flag throughout this tempting crisis.</p>

<p>"Many private letters have gone to the United
States, giving accounts of the vast quantity of gold
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
recently discovered, and it may be a matter of surprise
why I have made no report on this subject at an earlier
date. The reason is, that I could not bring myself
to believe the reports that I heard of the wealth of
the gold district until I visited it myself. I have no
hesitation now in saying that there is more gold in the
country drained by the Sacramento and San Joaquin
Rivers than will pay the cost of the present war with
Mexico a hundred times over. No capital is required
to obtain this gold, as the laboring man wants nothing
but his pick and shovel and tin pan, with which to dig
and wash the gravel; and many frequently pick gold
out of the crevices of the rocks with their butcher
knives, in pieces of from one to six ounces.</p>

<p>"Mr. Dye, a gentleman residing in Monterey, and
worthy of every credit, has just returned from Feather
River. He tells me that the company to which he
belonged worked seven weeks and two days, with an
average of fifty Indians (washers,) and that their gross
product was two hundred and seventy-three pounds
of gold. His share (one seventh,) after paying all
expenses, is about thirty-seven pounds, which he
brought with him and exhibited in Monterey. I see
no laboring man from the mines who does not show
his two, three, or four pounds of gold. A soldier of
the artillery company returned here a few days ago
from the mines, having been absent on furlough twenty
days. He made by trading and working, during that
time, $1500. During these twenty days he was
travelling ten or eleven days, leaving but a week in
which he made a sum of money greater than he receives
in pay, clothes, and rations, during a whole
enlistment of five years. These statements appear
incredible, but they are true.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span></p>

<p>"Gold is also believed to exist on the eastern slope
of the Sierra Nevada; and when at the mines, I was
informed by an intelligent Mormon that it had been
found near the Great Salt Lake by some of his fraternity.
Nearly all the Mormons are leaving California
to go to the Salt Lake, and this they surely would not
do unless they were sure of finding gold there in the
same abundance as they now do on the Sacramento.</p>

<p>"The gold 'placer' near the mission of San Fernando
has long been known, but has been little wrought
for want of water. This is a spur which puts off from
the Sierra Nevada (see Fremont's map,) the same in
which the present mines occur. There is, therefore,
every reason to believe, that in the intervening spaces,
of five hundred miles (entirely unexplored) there must
be many hidden and rich deposits. The 'placer' gold
is now substituted as the currency of this country; in
trade it passes freely at $16 per ounce; as an article
of commerce its value is not yet fixed. The only
purchase I made was of the specimen No. 7, which I
got of Mr. Neligh at $12 the ounce. That is about
the present cash value in the country, although it has
been sold for less. The great demand for goods and
provisions, made by this sudden development of wealth,
has increased the amount of commerce at San Francisco
very much, and it will continue to increase."</p>

<p><i>The Californian</i>, published at San Francisco on the
14th of August, furnishes the following interesting
account of the Gold Region:</p>

<p>"It was our intention to present our readers with a
description of the extensive gold, silver, and iron mines,
recently discovered in the Sierra Nevada, together
with some other important items, for the good of the
people, but we are compelled to defer it for a future
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
number. Our prices current, many valuable communications,
our marine journal, and other important
matters, have also been crowded out. But to enable
our distant readers to draw some idea of the extent
of the gold mine, we will confine our remarks to a few
facts. The country from the Ajuba to the San Joaquin
rivers, a distance of about one hundred and twenty
miles, and from the base toward the summit of the
mountains, as far as Snow Hill, about seventy miles,
has been explored, and gold found on every part.
There are now probably 3000 people, including Indians,
engaged collecting gold. The amount collected by
each man who works, ranges from $10 to $350 per
day. The publisher of this paper, while on a tour
alone to the mining district, collected, with the aid
of a shovel, pick and tin pan, about twenty inches in
diameter, from $44 to $128 a day&mdash;averaging $100.
The gross amount collected will probably exceed
$600,000, of which amount our merchants have received
about $250,000 worth for goods sold; all within
the short space of eight weeks. The largest piece of
gold known to be found weighed four pounds.</p>

<p>"Labor has ever been high in California, but previous
to the discovery of the <i>placera</i> gold, the rates
ranged from $1 to $3 per day. Since that epoch
common labor cannot be obtained, and if to be had,
for no less price than fifty cents per hour, and that the
most common. Carpenters and other mechanics have
been offered $15 a day, but it has been flatly refused.
Many of our enterprising citizens were largely engaged
in building, and others wish to commence on dwellings,
warehouses, and the like, but all have had to suspend
for the lack of that all important class of community,
the working men."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span></p>

<p>The following extracts from the published journal
of a physician in California, give accounts of the reception
of the news of the gold discovery in San Francisco,
with its consequent effects.</p>

<p>"<i>May 8th.</i>&mdash;Captain Fulsom called at Sweeting's
to-day. He had seen a man this morning, who reported
that he had just come from a river called the American
Fork, about one hundred miles in the interior, where
he had been gold washing. Captain Fulsom saw the
gold he had with him; it was about twenty-three
ounces weight, and in small flakes. The man stated
that he was eight days getting it, but Captain Fulsom
hardly believed this. He says that he saw some of
this gold a few weeks since, and thought it was only
'mica,' but good judges have pronounced it to be
genuine metal. He talks, however, of paying a visit
to the place where it is reported to come from. After
he was gone, Bradley stated that the Sacramento
settlements, which Malcolm wished to visit, were in
the neighborhood of the American Fork, and that we
might go there together; he thought the distance was
only one hundred and twenty miles.</p>

<p>"<i>May 10th.</i>&mdash;Yesterday and to-day nothing has
been talked of but the new gold 'placer,' as people
call it. It seems that four other men had accompanied
the person Captain Fulsom saw yesterday, and that
they had each realized a large quantity of gold. They
left the 'diggings' on the American Fork, (which it
seems is the Rio de los Americanos, a tributary to the
Sacramento) about a week ago, and stopped a day or
two at Sutter's Fort, a few miles this side of the diggings,
on their way; from there they had travelled
by boat to San Francisco. The gold they brought
has been examined by the first Alcalde here and by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
all the merchants in the place. Bradley showed us a
lump weighing a quarter of an ounce, which he had
bought of one of the men, and for which he gave him
three dollars and a half. I have no doubt in my own
mind about its being genuine gold. Several parties,
we hear, are already made up to visit the diggings;
and, according to the newspaper here, a number of
people have actually started off with shovels, mattocks,
and pans, to dig the gold themselves. It is not likely,
however, that this will be allowed, for Captain Fulsom
has already written to Colonel Mason about taking
possession of the mine on behalf of the government,
it being, as he says, on public land.</p>

<p>"<i>May 17th.</i>&mdash;This place is now in a perfect furor of
excitement; all the work-people have struck. Walking
through the town to-day, I observed that laborers
were employed only upon about half-a-dozen of the
fifty new buildings which were in the course of being
run up. The majority of the mechanics at this place
are making preparations for moving off to the mines,
and several hundred people of all classes&mdash;lawyers,
store-keepers, merchants, &amp;c.,&mdash;are bitten with the
fever; in fact, there is a regular gold mania springing
up. I counted no less than eighteen houses which were
closed, the owners having left."</p>

<p>The mania continued to increase, and within a few
months all the principal towns were nearly emptied
of their population. Gold was the universal object,
and splendid and rapid fortune the universal hope.
No occupation seemed to offer such a prospect as that
of digging gold, and, accordingly, those who were not
able to bear the fatigues of such work, or were at the
head of any sort of business in the different towns, had
to pay enormous prices for the labor of subordinates
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
who performed the meanest services. The prices of
all agricultural and manufactured products became
treble the previous rates.</p>

<p>Soon came the first waves of the tide of emigration
that was to flood the <i>placers</i> of the gold region. The
first influx consisted of Mexicans of the province of
Sonoma, Chilians, and some few Chinese. These,
principally took possession of the southern mines, or
those on the San Joaquin and its tributaries. Some
few stopped at San Francisco, and secured lots of
ground which they knew would become very valuable
in a short time, and erected temporary stores and
dwellings. This gave the impulse to the progress of
the town, and it soon advanced rapidly in size and
population. Then came the emigration from the
Atlantic States of the Union, and the whole territory
felt the progressive and enterprising spirit of the gold-seekers.
The Americans generally took possession
of the mines upon the northern tributaries of the
Sacramento River; but as their numbers increased
they pushed towards the southern mines, and frequent
collisions with the foreigners were the consequence.
Finally, a great number of the latter were compelled
to leave the country.

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<p class="center p2">
ADVENTURES OF SOME OF THE MINERS, AND INCIDENTS
CONNECTED WITH MINING.</p>

<p class="p2">The adventures of the eager gold-seekers in the
region of their hopes, among the washings and the
diggings of the <i>placers</i>, cannot but be interesting.
The toil to which the men have to submit if they would
obtain any thing like a satisfaction to their desires, is
of a very irksome character. In the summer season,
the heat is intense, and the principal part of the labor
of washing and digging must be performed exposed to
the full blaze of the sun. In the "dry diggings,"
the miners suffer greatly from the want of water.
Most of the provisions having to be transported from
the towns on the Sacramento and San Joaquin, soon
grow unwholesome from exposure to the sultry air of
the day and the damp air of the night. This diet,
conjointly with the exposure of the miners, tends to
produce intermittent fever and dysentery. The miners
generally reside in huts of a rude construction, or in
canvas tents, which afford but poor protection from
the changes of the weather.</p>

<p>The most prominent man in the neighborhood of
the "diggins," is Captain Sutter, the Daniel Boone
of that part of the country. He was formerly an
officer in the Swiss guards of Charles X. of France.
After the revolution of 1830, in that country, he came
to the United States. Emigrating to California, he
obtained a grant of land from the Mexican government,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
and founded the settlement known as Sutter's
Fort. Upon his land, the first discovery of the richness
of the soil was made, and his house and the
settlement around it has been, ever since, the resort
of persons going to and from the <i>placers</i>, and a depot
for provisions and articles used by the miners. Stores
and workshops have been established, and a considerable
amount of business is transacted there. Captain
Sutter is held in very great respect by the people of
the settlement and those stopping at his house on the
road to the <i>placers</i>. Several versions of the account
of the discovery of the gold mines have been circulated,
but the true one, in the Captain's own words,
is given in a work recently published.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> The account
is here inserted, both on account of the interest connected
with the discovery, and in order to correct
wrong versions of the matter.</p>

<p>"I was sitting one afternoon," said the Captain,
"just after my siesta, engaged, by-the-bye, in writing
a letter to a relation of mine at Lucerne, when I was
interrupted by Mr. Marshall&mdash;a gentleman with whom
I had frequent business transactions&mdash;bursting hurriedly
into the room. From the unusual agitation in
his manner, I imagined that something serious had
occurred, and, as we involuntarily do in this part of
the world, I at once glanced to see if my rifle was in
its proper place. You should know that the mere
appearance of Mr. Marshall at that moment in the
fort was quite enough to surprise me, as he had but
two days before left the place to make some alterations
in a mill for sawing pine planks, which he had
just run up for me, some miles higher up the Americanos.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
When he had recovered himself a little, he
told me that, however great my surprise might be at
his unexpected reappearance, it would be much greater
when I heard the intelligence he had come to bring
me. 'Intelligence,' he added, 'which, if properly
profited by, would put both of us in possession of unheard-of
wealth&mdash;millions and millions of dollars, in
fact.' I frankly own, when I heard this, that I thought
something had touched Marshall's brain, when suddenly
all my misgivings were put an end to by his
flinging on the table a handful of scales of pure virgin
gold. I was fairly thunderstruck, and asked him to
explain what all this meant, when he went on to say,
that, according to my instructions, he had thrown the
mill-wheel out of gear, to let the whole body of the water
in the dam find a passage through the tail-race, which
was previously too narrow to allow the water to run
off in sufficient quantity, whereby the wheel was prevented
from efficiently performing its work. By this
alteration the narrow channel was considerably enlarged,
and a mass of sand and gravel carried off by
the force of the torrent. Early in the morning after
this took place, he (Mr. Marshall) was walking along
the left bank of the stream, when he perceived something
which he at first took for a piece of opal&mdash;a
clear transparent stone, very common here&mdash;glittering
on one of the spots laid bare by the sudden crumbling
away of the bank. He paid no attention to this; but
while he was giving directions to the workmen, having
observed several similar glittering fragments, his
curiosity was so far excited, that he stooped down and
picked one of them up. 'Do you know,' said Mr.
Marshall to me, 'I positively debated within myself
two or three times whether I should take the trouble
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
to bend my back to pick up one of the pieces, and had
decided on not doing so, when, further on, another
glittering morsel caught my eye&mdash;the largest of the
pieces now before you. I condescended to pick it up,
and to my astonishment found that it was a thin scale
of what appears to be pure gold.' He then gathered
some twenty or thirty similar pieces, which on examination
convinced him that his suppositions were right.
His first impression was, that this gold had been lost
or buried there by some early Indian tribe&mdash;perhaps
some of those mysterious inhabitants of the West, of
whom we have no account, but who dwelt on this continent
centuries ago, and built those cities and temples,
the ruins of which are scattered about these
solitary wilds. On proceeding, however, to examine
the neighboring soil, he discovered that it was more or
less auriferous. This at once decided him. He mounted
his horse, and rode down to me as fast as it would
carry him, with the news.</p>

<p>"At the conclusion of Mr. Marshall's account,"
continued Captain Sutter, "and when I had convinced
myself, from the specimens he had brought with him,
that it was not exaggerated, I felt as much excited as
himself. I eagerly inquired if he had shown the gold
to the work people at the mill, and was glad to hear
that he had not spoken to a single person about it.
We agreed," said the Captain, smiling, "not to mention
the circumstance to any one, and arranged to set
off early the next day for the mill. On our arrival,
just before sundown, we poked the sand about in
various places, and before long succeeded in collecting
between us, more than an ounce of gold, mixed up
with a good deal of sand. I stayed at Mr. Marshall's
that night, and the next day we proceeded some little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
distance up the South Fork, and found that gold
existed along the whole course, not only in the bed of
the main stream, where the water had subsided, but
in every little dried-up creek and ravine. Indeed, I
think it is more plentiful in these latter places, for I
myself, with nothing more than a small knife, picked
out from a dry gorge, a little way up the mountain, a
solid lump of gold which weighed nearly an ounce and
a half.</p>

<p>"On our return to the mill, we were astonished by
the work-people coming up to us in a body, and showing
us small flakes of gold similar to those we had
ourselves procured. Marshall tried to laugh the matter
off with them, and to persuade them that what they
had found was only some shining mineral of trifling
value; but one of the Indians, who had worked at the
gold mine in the neighborhood of La Paz, in Lower
California, cried out, 'Oro! oro!' We were disappointed
enough at this discovery, and supposed that
the work-people had been watching our movements,
although we thought we had taken every precaution
against being observed by them. I heard, afterwards,
that one of them, a sly Kentuckian, had dogged us
about, and that, looking on the ground to see if he
could discover what we were in search of, he had
lighted on some flakes of gold himself.</p>

<p>"The next day I rode back to the Fort, organized
a laboring party, set the carpenters to work on a few
necessary matters, and the next day, accompanied
them to a point of the Fork, where they encamped
for the night. By the following morning I had a
party of fifty Indians fairly at work. The way we
first managed was to shovel the soil into small buckets,
or into some of our famous Indian baskets; then wash
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
all the light earth out, and pick away the stones;
after this, we dried the sand on pieces of canvas, and
with long reeds blew away all but the gold. I have
now some rude machines in use, and upwards of one
hundred men employed, chiefly Indians, who are well
fed, and who are allowed whisky three times a day.</p>

<p>"The report soon spread. Some of the gold was
sent to San Francisco, and crowds of people flocked
to the diggings. Added to this, a large emigrant
party of Mormons entered California across the Rocky
Mountains, just as the affair was first made known.
They halted at once, and set to work on a spot some
thirty miles from here, where a few of them still remain.
When I was last up to the diggings, there were
full eight hundred men at work, at one place and
another, with perhaps something like three hundred
more passing backwards and forwards between here
and the mines. I at first imagined that the gold
would soon be exhausted by such crowds of seekers,
but subsequent observations have convinced me that it
will take many years to bring about such a result,
even with ten times the present number of people
employed.</p>

<p>"What surprises me," continued the Captain, "is,
that this country should have been visited by so many
scientific men, and that not one of them should have
ever stumbled upon the treasures; that scores of
keen eyed trappers should have crossed this valley in
every direction, and tribes of Indians have dwelt in it
for centuries, and yet that this gold should have never
been discovered. I myself have passed the very spot
above a hundred times during the last ten years, but
was just as blind as the rest of them, so I must not
wonder at the discovery not having been made earlier."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span></p>

<p>The plan of operations adopted by most of the
miners who were not Indians or Californians, was to
form bands of three, five or ten, under the command
of one of the number, whose name the party took, and
by which it was afterwards known. Some larger
companies were formed in the United States, and
repaired to California, and their operations were of
course, on a more extensive scale; they having all
the necessary equipments of gold-washers and miners.
Written rules were generally drawn up for the government
of the parties, varying in particulars according
to the peculiar views of the framers. These rules
provided for the <i>modus operandi</i> of procuring the
gold, supplying the party with necessaries, attending
to the sick, and the division of the fruits of their labor.</p>

<p>One of the most frequented placers of California is
called the Stanislaus mine, situated near the Stanislaus
River. It was one of the first places worked to
any extent by the gold-seekers, but not satisfying the
expectations of some of the most greedy, it has since
been partially abandoned. A description of this mine,
and of the living and operations of its workers in the
winter of 1848-49, will give a good general idea of the
toils and privations endured by the early gold-seekers in
that region, and, also, of their mode of procuring the
precious metal at most of the mines. We extract
from a recently published work, distinguished for
minuteness of detail and accuracy of description.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>"The mine was a deep ravine, embosomed amidst
lofty hills, surmounted by, and covered with pine, and
having, in the bottom itself, abundance of rock, mud,
and sand. Halliday and I encamped at the very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
lowest part of the ravine, at a little distance from Don
Emanuel's party; a steep rock which towered above
our heads affording us shelter, and a huge, flat stone
beneath our feet promising a fair substitute for a dry
bed. Here then we stretched our <i>macheers</i> and
blankets, and arranged our saddles and bags, so as to
make ourselves as comfortable and warm as possible,
although, in spite of our precautions and contrivances,
and of a tolerably good fire, our encampment was
bitterly cold, and we lay exposed to a heavy dew.
We had given up our horses into the charge of the
Indians, and I saw to their being safely placed in the
<i>cavallard</i>, whilst Halliday went to chop wood; a task
I was too weak to perform. I cannot say we slept;
we might more correctly be said to have had a long
and most uncomfortable doze, and when morning
broke, we were shivering with cold, and shook the
dew in a shower from our clothes. I consulted with
my companion, and urged upon him the prudence of
our setting to work to construct ourselves a sort of log
cabin; otherwise I felt certain, from the experience
of the past night, our sojourn at the mines would be
likely to prove fatal to one or both of us. He was,
however, far too eager to try his fortune at digging
to listen to my proposal, at which he even smiled,
probably at the bare idea of weather, privation, or
toil, being able to affect his powerful frame. I saw
him presently depart up the ravine, shouldering a pick,
and glancing now and then at his knife, whilst I proceeded
in search of materials for constructing a temporary
place of shelter.</p>

<p>"As my strength was unequal to the task of felling
timber, I endeavored to procure four poles, intending
to sink them into the ground, and to stretch on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
top of them a bed-tick I had reserved for the purpose.
The contrivance was a sorry one at the best, but
shelter was indispensable; and great was my disappointment&mdash;though
I procured the timber after a painful
search&mdash;to find that the rocks presented an insuperable
obstacle to my employing it as I intended.
My efforts to sink the poles proved utterly futile, and
I was at last compelled to renounce the attempt in
despair. I then packed up our goods into as close a
compass as possible; and, having requested one of
the Spaniards in Don Emanuel's party to keep watch
over them, departed to explore the ravine.</p>

<p>"Within a few paces of our encampment there was
a large area of ground, probably half a mile square,
the surface of which consisted of dark soil and slate,
and was indented with innumerable holes of every
possible dimension, from six inches to as many feet or
more, wide and deep. In all of these lay abundance
of water, of which large quantities are to be found a
little beneath the surface, the ravine being supplied
with it in great abundance by the rains that pour
down from the hills during the wet season. To the
extreme right of our camp, the ground assumed a
more rocky character; and, from the vast deposit of
stagnant water, did not seem to offer many attractions
to the miners. Yet there was scarcely a spot in any
of these places where the crow-bar, the pick, or the
jack-knife, had not been busy: evidence that the
whole locality must have been extremely rich in the
precious metal, or it would not have been so thoroughly
worked.</p>

<p>"In crossing the ravine, I was obliged to leap from
one mound of earth to another, to avoid plunging
ancle-deep in mud and water. It was wholly deserted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
in this part, though formerly so much frequented; and,
with the exception of a few traders, who, having taken
up their station here when times were good, had not
yet made arrangements for removing to a more productive
place, not a soul was to be seen.</p>

<p>"I walked on until I reached the trading-post of
Mr. Anderson, formerly our interpreter in the Lower
Country, whom I felt delighted to meet with again.
His shed was situated in one of the dampest parts of
the mine, and consisted of a few upright poles, traversed
by cross-pieces, and covered in with raw hides
and leaves, but yet much exposed at the sides to the
wind and the weather. He had a few barrels of flour
and biscuit, which he retailed at two dollars a pound;
for he made no difference between the price of the
raw and the prepared material. The flour would go
further, it was true; but then the biscuit required no
cooking on the part of the miner, whose time was
literally money, and whose interest therefore it was to
economize it in every possible manner. He also sold
unprepared coffee and sugar at six Yankee shillings a
pound; dried beef at one dollar and a half; and
pork, which was regarded as a great delicacy here, at
two dollars for the same weight. The various articles
of which his stock-in-trade consisted he had brought
all the way from Monterey at considerable labor and
expense; but, by the exercise of extraordinary tact,
perseverance, and industry, he had succeeded in establishing
a flourishing business.</p>

<p>"I discovered, however, that he possessed another
resource&mdash;by which his gains were marvellously increased&mdash;in
the services of seven or eight Indians,
whom he kept constantly at work, in the rear of his
shed, digging gold, and whose labor he remunerated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
with provisions, and occasional presents of articles of
trifling value to him, but highly esteemed by the
Indians. They were watched by an American overseer,
who was employed by him, to assist in the general
business, particularly in slaughtering; for, as beef
was scarce, he used to send his man in quest of cows
and oxen; which he killed, cut up, salted and dried,
in his shed, and watching the most favorable moment
for the operation&mdash;namely, when meat could not be
procured at the 'diggins'&mdash;never failed to realize his
own price for it.</p>

<p>"Proceeding higher up the ravine, I observed a
large tent erected on the slope of a hill, within a few
yards of the bottom, where the gold is usually found.
It was surrounded by a trench, the clay from which,
as it was dug up, had apparently been thrown out
against the canvas, forming a kind of embankment,
rendering it at once water and weather-proof. I ventured
into it, encountering on my way an immense
piece of raw beef, suspended from the ridge-pole.
Upon some stones in front, inclosing a small fire, stood
a frying-pan, filled with rich looking beef collops,
that set my mouth watering, and severely tested my
honesty; for, although acorns are all very well in
their way, and serve to stay the cravings of the
stomach for awhile, I did not find my appetite any the
less sharp, notwithstanding the quantity I had eaten.
But I resisted the temptation, and penetrated further
into the tent. At one side of it lay a crow-bar, and
an old saddle that had seen rough service; yet not a
soul appeared, and my eyes were again ogling the
collops, whilst an inward voice whispered how imprudent
it was to leave them frizzling there, when, all at
once, a little man, in a 'hickory shirt,' with his face
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
all bedaubed with pot-black and grease, darted out of
some dark corner, flourishing in one hand a long bowie
knife, and in the other three by no means delicate
slices of fat pork, which he at once dropped into the
frying-pan, stooping down on one knee, and becoming
immediately absorbed in watching the interesting
culinary process then going on in it.</p>

<p>"I came up next with a group of three Sonomeans,
or inhabitants of Sonoma, busily engaged on a small
sandy flat&mdash;the only one I had observed&mdash;at the bottom
of the ravine. There was no water near, although
I noticed several holes which had evidently been sunk
in quest of it. These men were actively pursuing a
process that is termed 'dry-washing.' One was
shovelling up the sand into a large cloth, stretched
out upon the ground, and which, when it was tolerably
well covered, he took up by the corners, and shook
until the pebbles and larger particles of stone and dirt
came to the surface. These he brushed away carefully
with his hand, repeating the process of shaking
and clearing until the residue was sufficiently fine for
the next operation. This was performed by the other
men, who, depositing the sand in large bowls hewn
out of a solid block of wood, which they held in their
hands, dexterously cast the contents up before them,
about four feet into the air, catching the sand again
very cleverly, and blowing at it as it descended. This
process being repeated, the sand gradually disappeared,
and from two to three ounces of pure gold
remained at the bottom of the bowl. Easy as the
operation appeared to me to be, I learned, upon inquiry,
that to perform it successfully required the
nicest management, the greatest perseverance, and
especially robust lungs. The men I saw had lighted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
upon a productive sand; but very often, indeed, those
who adopt this mode of gold washing toil long at barren
soil before they discover the uselessness of laboring
thus arduously.</p>

<p>"I noticed, that although the largest proportion of
the gold obtained in this manner presented the appearance
of a fine powder, it was interspersed, here and
there, with large scales of the precious deposit, and
with a few solid lumps. The metal was of a dingy
hue, and, at a cursory view, might easily have been
mistaken for particles of yellow clay, or laminæ of
stone of the same color. The Sonomeans placed the
product of their labor in buckskin bags, which were
hung around their necks, and carefully concealed
inside of their shirts. They work in this fashion at
the mines in their own country; but I doubt if any
other than a native constitution could very long bear
up against the peculiar labor of 'dry-washing' in such
a climate and under such difficult circumstances. I
felt half tempted to try the process myself, for the
surface of this sandy bed was literally sparkling with
innumerable particles of the finest gold, triturated to
a polish by the running of the waters&mdash;as I conjectured;
but I soon discovered how fruitless my efforts
would be. Had I possessed any chemical agents at
hand, however, I might soon have exhausted the bed
of its precious contents, and should, doubtless, have
realized an immense weight of the metal of the very
purest quality.</p>

<p>"I may as well mention here, that of the various
new machines manufactured and sent out to California
for the purpose of digging and washing gold, the
great majority have been found quite useless. There
are two or three of them, however, that have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
employed with great success. I have made a sketch
of those most in use amongst the diggers, as my
readers may feel desirous of acquainting themselves
with the latest improvements introduced in the art of
mining, as practised in this country. They consist,
in the first place, of the washing-rocker, or 'cradle,'
which has, in numerous instances, formed the model
for ruder machines, constructed by the miners themselves,
whilst in the mountains. The lid, at the bottom
of which lie the holes through which the gold and soil
pass, is fastened by hinges at the back, in order that
it may be raised up, the more readily to throw off,
from time to time, the stones that accumulate. Three
men are required to work this rocker with success,
and there are few processes in which a smaller number
could operate without extraordinary labor. One
person throws the soil upon the lid, another pours on
the water, whilst a third is engaged in rocking the
cradle by the handle attached to it for the purpose.
In this way these men keep each other constantly
employed; and, indeed, this cradle, like its prototype,
has often proved the bond of union between individuals
who would otherwise have separated, for this simple
reason, that one man could not work it half so profitably
alone. The cross pieces, observable at the bottom,
serve to intercept the gold as it flows towards
the smaller end of the machine, whilst the dirt is
carried off by the admixture with the water produced
by the continual 'rocking.' As the earth becomes
thoroughly dissolved, the gold naturally gravitates to
the bottom; and thus it is impossible for any but the
very finest particles of the ore to escape.</p>

<p>"The second machine, in importance, is the gold-borer.
It is particularly useful in examining the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
bottom of streams, and consists of a short conical
cylinder at the end of a long handle, containing inside,
at its lower extremity, a valve, arranged so as to
admit the earth and gold, and prevent their escaping
when the receptacle is full. This instrument is used
in the same manner as an augur. The third machine,
the pan, is also of late introduction, but has been
found rather too deep for the purpose for which it is
intended.</p>

<p>"Notwithstanding the success which seemed to
attend the labors of the Sonomeans, I subsequently
discovered that the entire quantity of gold thus painfully
obtained, disappeared at the gambling-stalls. They
were generally clad most wretchedly, many of them
wearing nothing more than a dirty shirt, a pair of
light pantaloons, and the wide <i>sombrero</i> peculiar to the
inhabitants of this country and Mexico. Some few
sported a <i>serapa</i>, but they were men of superior native
rank, of which this garment is a distinctive characteristic.</p>

<p>"Continuing my route up the ravine, I met a man
named Corrigan, galloping along with two fine horses,
one of which he was leading. He stopped as soon as
he recognized me, and we were soon engaged in a very
interesting conversation respecting the doings at the
'diggins.' The substance of his information was, that
he had made a great deal of money at the mines by
digging, but infinitely more by speculation. He thought
of buying a <i>ranché</i>, marrying, and settling down. He
was then going to seek for pasture for his horses;
and, bidding me a hasty good-bye, galloped off, and
soon disappeared.</p>

<p>"As I advanced, the ground became drier and more
sandy, rock and slate of various kinds abounding;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
some quite soft and friable, yielding readily to the
pickaxe or the crowbar; and, in other places, so hard
as to resist the utmost strength of the miners. Several
of the diggers were perseveringly exploring the localities
where the rotten sorts of slate were found in the
largest quantities, and I saw them pick out a good
deal of gold with their jack-knives. Their principal
aim was to discover what they termed 'a pocket,'
which is nothing more than a crevice between the
blocks of slate, into which a deposit of gold has been
washed by the heavy rains from the higher districts,
and which, soon accumulating, swell into rapid torrents,
which rush down these ravines with extraordinary
swiftness and force, sweeping every thing
before them.</p>

<p>"There did not appear to be many mining parties
at the Stanislaus at this particular period, for the
encampments were generally from two to five miles
apart, the space between them increasing the higher
you advanced towards the mountains, to the foot of
which the ravine extended&mdash;altogether, a distance of
many miles. The lower part of the mine, I concluded
from this fact, to be by far the richer, simply from
the circumstance I have mentioned; richer, comparatively,
because here the deposits of gold are more
easily found and extracted; not richer, in reality, as
the metal must exist in immense quantities in the
upper regions, from which it is washed down by the
rains and floods into the lower districts. The virgin
deposit would, doubtless, be difficult to come at; but,
if sought after at all, that it is to be sought in the
mountains and high lands, I feel persuaded.</p>

<p>"I turned back, after prosecuting my excursion
until the ravine became almost too rocky to allow me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
to proceed, and until I saw that the 'diggins' diminished
materially in number. On clambering the hills
at the side, I beheld abundance of pines, oak, cedar,
and palm; but no grass, nor vegetation of any other
kind, save prickly shrubs, with here and there a patch
of extremely dry moss. On my way back, I passed
several tents and huts erected by the miners, all of
the very poorest and most wretched description.</p>

<p>"I found Van Anker's party at dinner, in front of
their tent. Van showed me a leathern bag, containing
several pounds' weight of very pure gold, and
which was carelessly tossed about from one to the
other for examination. It was the produce of his
morning's work, he having fortunately struck upon a
large pocket.</p>

<p>"On inquiring whether, as there existed such strong
temptation, robberies were not very frequent, I was
informed, that, although thefts had occurred, yet,
generally speaking, the miners dwelt in no distrust of
one another, and left thousands of dollars' worth in
gold dust in their tents whilst they were absent digging.
They all felt, intuitively, that honesty was
literally the best policy, and a determination to punish
robbery seemed to have been come to by all as a
measure essential to the security and welfare of the
mining community, independent of any question of
principle.</p>

<p>"Gambling and drinking were carried on, I found,
to a most demoralizing extent. Brandy and champagne,
whenever they were brought to the 'diggins,'
realized enormous prices, varying from sixteen to
twenty dollars a bottle; and some of the men would,
after accumulating some hundred dollars, squander the
whole in purchasing these beverages. Believing the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
supply of gold to be inexhaustible, they persisted in
this reckless course, and discovered only when it became
too late to redeem their error, that even here
gold cannot always be procured. They went on until
the <i>placers</i> failed to yield, and were then reduced to
great extremities.</p>

<p>"The miners were by no means averse to lending
'dust' to those who required it, notwithstanding that
the lenders often experienced some difficulty in getting
back the advance. One of Van's party, for instance,
lent another six ounces of gold, which not being
returned at the stipulated period, nor for some time
afterwards, he dunned his debtor every meal, until
the latter, who had quietly submitted to the importunity,
begged him to 'just wait ten minutes, and time
it.' He shouldered his pickaxe, as he said this, and
going out of the shed, returned within the time, bringing
back more than sufficient to liquidate the debt.
This little incident created much amusement."</p>

<p>The whole of the gold region lies between the San
Joachin and Sacramento Rivers and the California
range of mountains. The principal mines are the
Towallomie, the Stanislaus, the Macalamo, the Merced,
Fremont's Diggings, or Mariposa, the Calaveras, the
Macassime, the South, Middle, and North Forks,
Bear Creek, Yuba, Feather River, and the Sacramento.
The mines are nothing more than so many
ravines, which run across from the range of mountains,
and are flooded by the torrents which pour down from
the upper region during the rainy season, and which
have been supposed to bring the gold down with them.</p>

<p>The Macalamo Dry Diggings is considered one of
the richest placers in the gold region. It is a long
ravine, the soil of which is red, and sometimes blueish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
in places, sand predominating. The blue clay is
thought to be the richest by the diggers. The sides
of the ravine are so steep and irregular, that the miners
are troubled to find resting places of a night. The
gold taken out of this mine runs large; the average
size of the lumps being that of a pea. Pieces have
been taken out of it that weighed above two pounds.</p>

<p>Instances of robbery and murder have not been few in
the gold region, as might be conjectured from a knowledge
of the motley character of the miners, and the
temptations offered to avaricious spirits. Yet, all
things considered, the number of instances will not
appear so very extraordinary. Lynch law, the only
resort of the wronged in pocket, or the friends of the
murdered, exercised its terrible power, and tended to
prevent the crimes that would, otherwise, have been
frequent. An instance of this summary justice we
here relate, to illustrate the means by which the miners
protected their lives and property.</p>

<p>"A sailor, a deserter from the Ohio, took it into
his head, one night, to rob one of the volunteers, who
had set up a drinking store. He had already got two
bags, containing about five thousand dollars' worth of
gold; but, not satisfied with them, grasped at a third,
half full of dollars in silver. The jingling of the coin
awoke the owner, who, springing up, gave the alarm,
and, after a hot pursuit, the thief was captured, and
bound to a tree until morning. At about nine, a jury
of twelve miners sat to consider the case, a volunteer
named Nutman officiating for Judge Lynch. Of
course, he was found guilty, and sentenced to be
hanged; but, some opposition being raised to depriving
him of life, and a milder punishment suggested; it was
finally determined that he should receive a hundred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
lashes on his bare back, have his ears cut off, and his
head shaved, so that he might be every where recognized
in the mining districts. This sentence gave
general satisfaction. The poor wretch was at once
fastened by his hands to the branch of a tree, and the
fellows proceeded to shave his head, whilst some
sailors of the party set to work manufacturing cats.
His feet were then tied together to the foot of the tree,
and when his head had been shaved, a doctor lopped
off his ears. He bled a good deal; but, when the
blood was staunched, they set to flogging him, and
they didn't spare him either. After this, they kicked
him out.</p>

<p>"Well, he went off, and when he was about half a
mile away, stole a mule, and rode over to the 'Calaveras'
diggins, where the animal was claimed by the
owner. He was thereupon tried for mule-stealing,
and sentenced to receive another flogging; but when
the miners came to strip him, they found his back so
shockingly cut up, that they took compassion on him,
and contented themselves with driving him out of the
district, where he never appeared again."</p>

<p>During the summer season, when exposure and
labor in the mines, together with unwholesome food,
produce a great prevalence of fever and dysentery,
the native Californians make use of a singular remedy.
It is called the temascal; being a sort of hot air bath,
shaped something like a sentry-box. It is built of
wicker-work, and afterwards plastered with mud until
it becomes air tight. The mode of application of this
remedy is as follows:&mdash;A large fire is built close up
to the door of the structure&mdash;a narrow aperture, just
large enough for a man to squeeze through. This is
allowed to burn itself out, having while burning,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
heated to a very high degree the air in the interior
of the box. Into this the patient screws himself, and
there remains until a profuse perspiration is produced,
which is checked suddenly by a plunge into the chilly
waters of the river. This is of the nature of a Thompsonian
remedy.</p>

<p>The absorbing interest with which the gold-seekers
proceed in their work is admirably depicted by one
of the adventurers, in a book published after his
return.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>"Arriving on the <i>bar</i>, the scene presented to us
was new indeed, and not more extraordinary than
impressive. Some with long-handled shovels, delved
among clumps of bushes, or by the side of large rocks,
never raising their eyes for an instant; others with
pick and shovel worked among stone and gravel, or
with trowels searched under banks and roots of trees,
where, if rewarded with small lumps of gold, the eye
shone brighter for an instant, when the search was
immediately and more ardently resumed. At the
edge of the stream, or knee deep and waist deep in
water, as cold as melted ice and snow could make it,
some were washing gold with tin pans or the common
cradle rocker, while the rays of the sun were pouring
down on their heads, with an intensity exceeding any
thing we ever experienced at home, though it was but
the middle of April.</p>

<p>"The thirst for gold and the labor of acquisition
overruled all else, and totally absorbed every faculty.
Complete silence reigned among the miners; they
addressed not a word to each other, and seemed averse
to all conversation. All the sympathies of common
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
humanity, all the finer and noble attributes of our
nature seemed lost, buried beneath the soil they were
eagerly delving, or swept away with the rushing waters
that revealed the shining treasure."</p>

<p>This extract is suggestive of considerable reflection.
The same amount of attention given to any pursuit
must produce results equally as satisfactory as that
given to gold-seeking. But gold carries with it such
obvious enjoyments to the grosser minds, that the
pursuit of it alone can attract their attention sufficiently
to effect any thing considerable. Could the pure
enjoyments connected with the practice of virtue be
made as obvious to all minds, the result would be
something at which the philanthropist might rejoice.</p>

<p>The extremes of heat and cold, during the summer,
in the valleys and <i>cañons</i> of the gold region, are very
remarkable. From nine o'clock in the morning till
five in the afternoon, the heat is almost intolerable.
The sun's rays pour down through an atmosphere
clear and dry, and their power is increased by reflection
from the sides of the <i>cañons</i> and mountains, and
from the surface of the streams. During the night,
the air becomes so cold as to render blankets very
serviceable. This is caused by the waters of the different
streams rising during the night, their volume being
increased by the melting of the snows of the Sierra
Nevada, by the heat of the previous day.</p>

<p>Thousands of Indians, belonging to the Snake,
Shoshonee, and Crow tribes, are at work at the mines.
They are generally employed by some of the wealthy
white men, and are paid in provisions and a sort of
liquor made from California grapes, called pisco.
What money or gold they get for themselves is spent
in gambling&mdash;a vice to which they are most excessively
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
addicted. Instances are not few of their having
staked the produce of their labor during some weeks
subsequent to the game. Many of the Indians desire
no other pay than as much pisco as they can drink,
with a little acorn bread.</p>

<p>The native Californians form a goodly proportion
of the gold-seekers. Many of the men are accompanied
by their wives, who are attended by Indian
girls. The graceful Spanish costume of the Californians
adds quite a feature to the busy scene at the
mines. There may be seen the long, lank forms of
the Yankees, with their wide white trousers and straw
hats; the half-naked Indians; the native born Californians,
with their dusky visages and lustrous black
eyes. The latter are generally clad in a short, tight
jacket, with lace trimming, and velvet breeches, with
a silk sash fastened round the waist. With regard to
the appearance of the women, and, also, for the sake
of the description of one of the evening entertainments
in the gold region, we quote from a recent tourist, to
whom we have been indebted before.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>"The appearance of the women is graceful and
coquettish. Their petticoats, short enough to display
in most instances a well-turned ankle, are richly
laced and embroidered, and striped and flounced with
gaudy colors, of which scarlet seems to have the preference.
Their tresses hang in luxuriant plaits down
their backs; and in all the little accessories of dress,
such as earrings, necklaces, &amp;c., the costume is very
rich. Its distinguishing feature, however, is the
<i>reboso</i>, a sort of scarf, generally made of cotton,
which answers to the mantilla of Old Spain. It is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
worn in many different and graceful fashions&mdash;sometimes
twined round the waist and shoulders; at others,
hanging in pretty festoons about the figure, but always
disposed with that indescribable degree of coquettish
grace which Spanish women have been for ages
allowed to possess in the management of the fan and
the mantilla. Since these arrivals, almost every
evening a fandango is got up on the green, before
some of the tents. The term fandango, though originally
signifying a peculiar kind of dance, seemed to be
used here for an evening's dancing entertainment, in
which many different <i>pas</i> are introduced. I was present
at a fandango a few nights ago, when a couple
of performers were dancing 'el jarabe,' which seemed
to consist chiefly of a series of monotonous toe and
heel movements on the ground. The motions of the
foot were, however, wonderfully rapid, and always in
exact time to the music. But at these entertainments
the waltz seems to be the standing dish. It is danced
with numerous very intricate figures, to which however,
all the Californians appear quite <i>au fait</i>. Men and
women alike waltz beautifully, with an easy, graceful
swinging motion.</p>

<p>"It is quite a treat, after a hard day's work,
to go at nightfall to one of these fandangos. The
merry notes of the guitar and the violin announce
them to all comers; and a motley enough looking
crowd, every member of which is puffing away
at a cigar, forms an applauding circle around the
dancers, who smoke like all the rest. One cannot
help being struck by the picturesque costume and
graceful movements of the performers, who appear to
dance not only with their legs, but with all their hearts
and souls. During the interval between the dances,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
coffee is consumed by the senoras, and the coffee with
something stronger by the senors; so that, as the
night advances, the merriment gets, if not 'fast and
furious,' at least animated and imposing."</p>

<p>The dangers which the adventurers are subjected to
encounter are often increased by the hostility of the
Indians. These, however, only molest those who are
daring enough to frequent the outskirts of the gold
region. There the Indians are treacherous, and will
attack small parties, even after smoking the pipe of
peace with them. Their principal weapons are bows
and arrows; for though many of them have guns in
their possession, the scarcity of ammunition prevents
them from using them to any purpose. The following
description of an encounter with them by a small party,
encamped in the valley of the Bear River, then seldom
frequented by white men, will give an idea of their
mode of attack:</p>

<p>"We were just on the point of returning to the
camp to dinner, when Dowling, who was standing near
some sage bushes at the upper part of the ravine,
heard a rustling among them, and on moving in the
direction of the noise saw an Indian stealthily creeping
along, who, as soon as he perceived he was discovered,
discharged an arrow which just missed its mark, but
lacerated, and that rather severely, Dowling's ear.
The savage immediately set up a most terrific whoop,
and ran off, but tumbled before he could draw another
arrow from his quiver, while Dowling, rushing forward,
buried his mattock in the head of his fallen foe,
killing him instantaneously.</p>

<p>"At this moment we heard the crack of a rifle in
the direction of the camp, which, with the Indian's
whoop at the same moment, completely bewildered us.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
Every man, however, seized his rifle, and Dowling,
hastening towards us, told us of what had just occurred.
All was still for the next few moments, and I mounted
a little hill to reconnoitre. Suddenly I saw a troop of
Indians, the foremost of them on horseback, approaching
at full speed. I hastily returned to my companions,
and we sought shelter in a little dell, determined to
await there, and resist the attack, for it was evident
that the savages' intentions were any thing but pacific.</p>

<p>"It was a moment of breathless excitement. We
heard the tramp, tramp of the horses coming on
towards us, but as yet, they and their riders were
concealed from our view. I confess I trembled violently,
not exactly with fear, although I expected that
a few moments would see us all scalped by our savage
assailants. It was the suddenness of the danger which
startled me, and made my heart throb violently; but
at that moment, just as I was reproaching myself with
the want of courage, a terrific yell rung through the
air at a short distance from us, and forty or fifty warlike
Indians appeared in sight. My whole frame was
nerved in an instant, and when a shower of arrows
flew amongst us, I was the first man to answer it with
a rifle-shot, which brought one of the foremost Indians
off his horse to the ground. I instantly reloaded, but
in the mean while the rifles of my companions had been
doing good service. We had taken up our position
behind a row of willow trees which skirted the banks
of a narrow stream, and here we were protected in a
great measure from the arrows of our assailants, which
were in most cases turned aside by the branches. A
second volley of rifle-shots soon followed the first;
and while we were reloading, and the smoke had
slightly cleared away, I could see that we had spread
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
consternation in the ranks of the Indian warriors, and
that they were gathering up their wounded preparatory
to retiring. I had my eye on an old man, who
had just leaped from his horse. My finger was on
the trigger, when I saw him coolly advance, and,
taking one of his wounded companions, who had been
shot through the leg, in his arms, place him on a
horse, then mounting his own, and catching hold of
the other animal's bridle, gallop off at full speed.
Although I knew full well that if the fortune of the
day had gone against us, these savages would not
have spared a single man of our party, still I could
not find it in my heart to fire on the old chief, and he
carried off his wounded comrade in safety.</p>

<p>"In a few minutes the hill-sides were clear, and
when we emerged from our shelter, all that was visible
of the troop of warriors was three of them weltering
in their blood, a bow or two, and some empty quivers,
and a few scattered feathers and tomahawks, lying on
the ground."</p>

<p>The grizzly bear is also one of the terrors encountered
by the gold-seekers. This animal grows to the
size of four feet in height and six in length. It is one
of the most ferocious animals of North America.
Mules and cattle of various kinds, and even men, are
attacked by it, and its great strength generally enables
it to come off with its prey. Great quickness and
courage are absolute essentials of those who hunt these
animals, or encounter them accidentally. An adventure
of two or three gold-seekers, on their road to the
mines, accidentally meeting with a grizzly bear, is
thus shortly detailed in the journal of a returned
adventurer.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span></p>

<p>"About half way from the <i>rancheria</i> a loud braying,
followed by a fierce growl, attracted our attention,
and in a few moments a frightened mule, closely pursued
by an enormous grizzly bear, descended the
hill-side within forty yards of where we stood leaning
on our rifles. As the bear reached the road, Higgins,
with his usual quickness and intrepidity, fired, and an
unearthly yell from the now infuriated animal told
with what effect. The mule in the interval had crossed
the road, and was now scampering away over the
plains, and Bruin, finding himself robbed of his prey,
turned upon us. I levelled my rifle and gave him the
contents with hearty good will, but the wounds he had
received only served to exasperate the monster, who
now made towards us with rapid strides. Deeming
prudence the better part of valor, we ran with all convenient
speed in the direction of the camp, within a
hundred yards of which my foot became entangled in
the underbrush, and I fell headlong upon the earth.
In another instant I should have fallen a victim to
old Bruin's rage, but a well-directed ball from my
companion's rifle entered his brain and arrested his
career. The whole party now came to our assistance
and soon despatched Mr. Grizzly. Dragging him to
camp, we made a hearty supper from his fat ribs, and,
as I had probably been the more frightened of the
two, I claimed as an indemnity his skin, which protected
me afterward from the damp ground many a
cold night. He was a monstrous fellow, measuring
nearly four feet in height, and six in length, and a
stroke from his huge paw would, had he caught us,
have entirely dissipated the golden dreams of Higgins
and myself."</p>

<p>The same writer gives quite a graphic description
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
of an attack of the scourge of the miners, the disease
called scurvy. He says:</p>

<p>"I was again dreaming of fortune and success, when
my hopes were blasted by an attack of a terrible
scourge that wrought destruction through the northern
mines during the winter of 1848. I allude to the land
scurvy. The exposed and unaccustomed life of two-thirds
of the miners, and their entire subsistence upon
salt meat, without any mixture of vegetable matter,
had produced this disease, which was experienced more
or less by one-half of the miners within my knowledge.
Its symptoms and progress may not be uninteresting.
It was first noticed in the 'Dry Diggings,' where,
about the middle of February, many persons were
rendered unable to walk by swellings of the lower
limbs, and severe pains in them. It was at first supposed
to be rheumatism, and was treated as such.
But it withstood the most powerful applications used
in that complaint, and was finally decided to be scurvy.
So long as the circumstances which caused it continued,
the disease made rapid progress. Many, who could
obtain no vegetables, or vegetable acids, lingered out
a miserable existence and died,&mdash;while others, fortunate
enough to reach the settlements, where potatoes
and acids could be procured, recovered. I noticed its
first attack upon myself by swelling and bleeding of
the gums, which was followed by a swelling of both
legs below the knee, which rendered me unable to
walk; and for three weeks I was laid up in my tent,
obliged to feed upon the very articles that had caused
the disease, and growing daily weaker, without any
reasonable prospect of relief. There were, at that
time, about eight hundred persons at work on the river,
and hoping to get some medicine, I despatched one of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
my companions one morning, with instructions to
procure me, if possible, a dose of salts, and to pay for
it any price that should be asked. He returned at
night with the consoling news that he had failed,
having found only two persons who had brought the
article with them, and they refused to sell it at any price.</p>

<p>"I was almost in despair; with only a blanket between
myself and the damp, cold earth, and a thin
canvas to protect me from the burning sun by day,
and the heavy dews by night, I lay day after day
enduring the most intense suffering from pain in my
limbs, which were now becoming more swollen, and
were turning completely black. Above me rose those
formidable hills which I must ascend ere I could
obtain relief. I believe I should have died, had not
accident discovered the best remedy that could have
been produced. In the second week of my illness,
one of our party, in descending the hill on which he
had been deer hunting, found near its base, and strewn
along the foot-track, a quantity of beans which sprouted
from the ground, and were in leaf. Some one, in
descending the hill with a bag of them on his back,
had probably dropped them. My companion gathered
a quantity and brought them into camp. I had them
boiled, and lived entirely on them for several days, at
the same time using a decoction of the bark of the
spruce tree. These seemed to operate magically; and
in a week after commencing the use of them, I found
myself able to walk,&mdash;and as soon as my strength was
partially restored, I ascended the hill, and with two
companions walked into Culoma; and by living principally
upon a vegetable diet, which I procured by
paying three dollars per pound for potatoes, in a very
short time I recovered."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span></p>

<p>Thus life in the gold region is made up of variety
and contrast. Sometimes the diggers and washers
pass weeks busily engaged at their toilsome occupation,
without the monotony of the time and scene being
disturbed. Again, adventures and exciting incidents
will be plentiful and various. At one time, pleasant
weather and fandangos offer easy enjoyment; at
another, extremes of weather, hard work, and bad
food render the life of the miner almost intolerable.
Frequently, the gold-seeker chances to meet spots
that yield ample reward for his toil; and often he
works beneath the fierce rays of a broiling sun, while
his legs are in chilly water, and his day's toil scarce
yields more than enough to pay for his living. The
trading-posts, situated at and near the mines, do a far
more certain and an equally profitable business. They
are generally the establishments of shrewd, speculating
Yankees, who know what sort of labor is requisite
to make a gold-seeker successful, and prefer to trust
to the profits of bargaining in provisions and mining
necessaries for gold.</p>

<p>That the country is pregnant with an enormous
quantity of the precious metal is unquestionable. But
that severe and weakening labor, together with tough
constitutions, are indispensable requisites for procuring
it, scarcely admits of a doubt. Very few spend
any considerable time in working at the "diggings,"
who do not suffer from exposure, and lose a portion
of their constitutional stability. So far, all attempts
at the construction of machines for washing the gold
from the sand, have been of little avail. Machines
have been invented and carried out to the gold region
by some of the numerous companies, which, upon
trial, have soon been abandoned for the "cradle," and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
common wash pan; but still, the field for invention is
open, and the labor now necessary for procuring the
gold is susceptible of considerable diminution. Of
course, the means of transporting provisions and other
necessaries to the mines are constantly improving, as
the country is becoming settled; and thus, one great
source of privation and disease is rapidly diminishing.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<p class="center p2">
DESCRIPTION OF SOME OF THE CITIES AND TOWNS OF
CALIFORNIA, BEFORE AND AFTER THE DISCOVERY OF
THE GOLD MINES.</p>

<p class="p2">At the time of the discovery of the existence of
gold in the region of the Sacramento, San Francisco
was a very inconsiderable town. As soon as the news
of the discovery was spread among its inhabitants, it
became almost deserted. Indeed, at one time, there
was only seven male inhabitants left in the town. The
site of the present city of San Francisco was not then
occupied by more than fifty houses in all. These
were occupied by a few foreign merchants and some
native Californians. The houses were rudely constructed,
the principal materials being adobés, or unburnt
bricks. They were generally one story high,
and most of them were erected near the beach; while at
the rear of the "town," was a sandy plain terminated
by a range of hills. But as soon as the news of the
gold discovery reached the United States, and other
countries, companies for mining purposes were immediately
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
formed, and emigrants soon crowded every
route to the "Land of Promise." Then San Francisco
began to be the great receptacle of the emigrants and
the merchandise of various kinds necessary for their
maintenance. The following is a very complete picture
of the city after the spreading of the gold news,
and the flood of emigration had commenced.</p>

<p>"Numberless vessels, mostly from the United States,
filled the bay, in front of San Francisco, many of them
being deserted by their crews, and unable to procure
others to take their places. On landing, I had to
clamber up a steep hill, on the top of which, and
opposite to where I stood, was a large wooden house,
two stories high, and scarcely half finished. In the
rear of this, rose another and a steeper hill, whose
slopes were covered with a multiplicity of tents. To
my right, ran a sort of steep, or precipice, defended
by sundry pieces of cannon, which commanded the
entrance to the harbor. I next came to the 'Point,'
and, crossing it, found myself within the town.</p>

<p>"The first objects that attracted my notice were
several canvas houses, measuring from ten to forty
feet square, some being grog-shops, others eating
establishments, and the larger set apart as warehouses,
or places of storage. The proprietors of the latter
were making enormous sums by the accommodation
their tents afforded to the hundreds of travellers who
were arriving every day from different parts, and who,
being extremely embarrassed as to what they should
do with their luggage, were heartily glad to find any
safe place to store it in, and content to pay for the
convenience.</p>

<p>"The spectacle which the beach presented from a
convenient opening, whence I could comprise the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
whole at a glance, was singularly interesting and
curious. A crowd of individuals, in motley garb, and
of every variety of race, might be seen pressing eagerly
upward towards the town, jostling and pushing one
another, in their anxiety to be first, yet looking eagerly
about them, as if to familiarize themselves at once
with the country of their adoption. Here were dandies
from the United States and from France, picking their
steps mincingly, as they strove to keep pace with the
sturdy fellows who carried their luggage; their beaver
hats, fashionable frock-coats, irreproachable and well-strapped
pantaloons, exciting the derisive remarks of
the spectators, the majority of them 'old Californians,'
whose rough labor at the 'diggins' had taught them
to estimate such <i>niaiseries</i> at their proper value. By
their side stalked the stately and dignified Spaniard,
covered with his broad-brimmed, low-crowned <i>sombrero</i>,
and gracefully enveloped in his ample <i>serapa</i>, set off
by a bright scarlet sash. He turns neither to the
right nor to the left, nor heeds the crowd about him,
but keeps on the even tenor of his way&mdash;though even
he has occasionally to jump for it&mdash;presenting, in his
demeanor and costume, a striking contrast to the
more bustling activity of the Yankees, who are elbowing
every one, in their anxiety to go a-head. A lot
of shopboys, too&mdash;mere lads, as spruce and neatly
attired as though they had just stepped out of some
fashionable emporium, mingle with the rest, and, as
they enter the town, strike up the popular parody&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>'Oh, California. That's the land for me!</p>
<p>I'm bound for the Sacramento, with</p>
<p>The wash-bowl on my knee.'</p>
</div>

<p>And presently, their brother-adventurers, excited
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
by hopes of the wildest kind, join vociferously in
chorus, in the exuberance of their joy.</p>

<p>"A group of Englishmen, muscular in form, and
honest in feature, are chaffering with the keen-witted
Yankee porters for the carriage of their luggage.
There is an air of dogged resolution about them, that
plainly indicates they will not submit to what they
evidently consider an imposition. Such a sum for so
slender a service! Well, then, they can carry their
baggage themselves: so they will; and, quickly
shouldering it, some depart in the track of the rest,
whilst two or three remain behind, to watch what is
left, until their friends return. They are manifestly
well known to one another, and seem to be almost
intimate; the voyage has made them friends.</p>

<p>"Here come a number of Chilians and Peruvians,
and a goodly number of natives from the Sandwich
Islands. A couple of Irishmen, too! I know them
by their vivacity, and by the odd trick they have of
getting into every body's way; to say nothing of their
broad, merry faces. Their property is in common, it
seems; for they have only one small pack between
them.</p>

<p>"Here come ten or a dozen plainly but comfortably
dressed mechanics; hard-working men they seem, and
just the sort of persons to make their way in a country
where the artisan occupies his proper position, and
where honest toil&mdash;and dishonest, too, sometimes&mdash;is
almost certain to reap a harvest. Far differently will
you fare, and far preferable, too, will be your lot, in
regions where privation is the rule, to that of many
amongst your numerous fellow-travellers, unaccustomed
as they are to laborious occupations&mdash;with
frames uninured to fatigue, and constitutions unhabituated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
to scanty fare, to exposure to heat and cold,
and wet and sudden changes! Whilst you are succeeding
in your object, they will grow wearied, disappointed,
and home-sick, and long to be back again on the
theatre of their former struggles.</p>

<p>"The human stream ceases not to flow from the
vessels in the harbor; no sooner is one boat-load
disposed of than another arrives, and so on, until the
town is gorged with new-comers, who, after a few
days' sojourn, to recruit their strength, after the
fatigues of a long and irksome voyage, depart, and
are seen no more for months; many, perhaps, never
to return. Very few of this vast multitude deserve
the epithet of poor. To get here at all requires
money; and to maintain one's self after getting here,
the emigrant must have some little means.</p>

<p>"The majority of the emigrants are men occupying
a respectable station in society; some are even
distinguished in their calling; but the eager desire of
making a fortune in a hurry has induced them to
throw up good employments and comfortable homes;
to leave friends, relatives, connexions, wife, children,
and familiar associations, to embark their strength,
intelligence, and activity, in this venture. All is
bustle where they have landed: boats going to and
fro; rafts slowly discharging their cumbrous loads;
porters anxiously and interestedly civil; all excited;
all bent on gain; ships innumerable in the bay;
mountains around; a clear, blue sky above; and the
bright waters dancing in the sun, until they touch the
horizon in the distance, blending their brightness with
his golden track.</p>

<p>"I walked on until I came up to a group of men,
who, like myself, were looking on the busy scene
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
before us with no small degree of interest. I recognized
amongst them two of the volunteers, with whom
I forthwith claimed acquaintance. The whole party
had come from the mines, as was easily to be seen
from their appearance, which was something the
worse for wear, their countenances being weather-beaten
and bronzed by exposure; whilst their attire,
consisting of buckskin coats, leather leggings, and
broad-brimmed hats, denoted the sort of labor in
which they had been recently engaged. I learned
from them, in the course of a subsequent conversation,
that they had all of them been successful at the 'diggings.'
One of the number had made, or 'picked,'
two thousand dollars, and the rest, from that to nine
thousand dollars each, within the space of a few
months. With this, however, they were far from
satisfied, most of them being determined to realize a
large fortune before they quitted the country; for not
one of them seemed to have the remotest intention of
settling.</p>

<p>"The party had come down from the mines to make
purchases, and to enjoy a little recreation. They were
admirable specimens of their class&mdash;hardy in appearance
and rough in demeanor; but shrewd, withal, and
toil-enduring. For the moment, their conversation
turned upon the prospects of the newly-landed emigrants&mdash;for
I should have stated that there were one or two
arrivals in the harbor&mdash;and they were unsparing of
their remarks upon such of the new comers as by their
dress, or any physical peculiarity, offered a fair target
for their witticisms, which were not less pointed than
coarse.</p>

<p>"The discovery of the gold mines, has done at
once for San Francisco what it was reasonable to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
anticipate time only could have effected; and its progress
in importance has far outstripped the most
sanguine expectations which could be based upon any
hypothesis hazarded on the strength of its admirable
position and facilities for trade. Nevertheless, its
growth seems unnatural; and, looking at it as I saw
it then, it left on my mind the impression of instability,
so marvellous was it to gaze upon a city of tents, wood,
and canvas, starting up thus suddenly, forming but a
halting-place to the thousands who visited it; having
for citizens a large majority of gamblers and speculators;
and presenting of civilization but the rudest
outline, and some of its worst vices. It was impossible,
indeed, for an observer to contemplate San Francisco,
at this particular period of its history, and not to feel
that every thing about it savored of transition. A
storm or a fire must have destroyed the whole in a few
hours; for every house, shed, or tent, had manifestly
been constructed merely to serve the end of the actual
occupier; they were all adapted for trading, but not
a convenience or a comfort appertained to them, to
indicate a desire or an intention of settlement. Every
day brought new-comers, and added to the number of
ephemeral structures which crowded the hill-sides.
Mechanics of every description of calling were at work,
earnestly, busily, and cheerfully; and, whichever way
I turned, there was bustle and activity; yet, withal, I
felt that such a state of things was unsound, because
resting on what was essentially speculative, and I
doubted not but a great change must come before the
city could be regarded as substantially advancing.
Comprised at a glance, it presented no other appearance
save that of a confused crowd of tenements,
of every variety of construction; some high, some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
low, perched upon the steep hills, or buried in the
deep valleys&mdash;but still tents and canvas every
where and any where, their numbers defying calculation,
their structure and position all analysis. There
existed neither wells nor ponds within a very considerable
distance; and what struck me as most singular,
being aware that the Spaniards had a mission here,
there was no sign of a church. I subsequently ascertained
that the site of the Mission of Dolores, about
five miles distant, had been preferred by the Spaniards,
and that divine service was performed there still.</p>

<p>"As I proceeded along the road leading into the
principal street of the city, I was uncomfortably reminded
that it would soon become necessary for me to
select a place where I could procure refreshment;
and in connexion with this necessity, arose another
consideration no less important, namely, where I should
lodge? There was no other mode of solving the difficulty,
save by an exploration of the localities; accordingly,
I kept these objects in view, whilst I also gratified
my curiosity by continuing my perambulations.</p>

<p>"In this same road, but nearer to the entrance of
the main street than I should say was, under any circumstances,
altogether pleasant, stood the <i>correl</i> of the
Washington Market, being a spacious area of ground,
inclosed with stakes, over which were stretched raw
hides. Owing to the large number of cattle slaughtered
here for the use of the inhabitants, the odor
from this place was insufferable, and I quickened my
pace until my olfactory organs became sensible of a
purer atmosphere.</p>

<p>"I turned into the principal street, and soon came
up to the market itself, which is a wooden house, about
thirty feet square, kept by an American. To my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
right, as I advanced, were some stores and hotels,
and a confectioner's shop of remarkably neat and
clean appearance: these were all one story, wooden
buildings. One of the hotels was appropriately designated
as 'The Colonnade.' It was kept by a volunteer
named Huxley, and differed from every similar
establishment in the town, inasmuch as the proprietor
allowed neither gambling nor drunkenness on his
premises. To this the 'Gotham Saloon,' a little further
on, offered a perfect contrast, for here there were
several <i>monté</i> rooms and a large bowling-alley, where
persons who had a taste for the latter amusement
might indulge in their favorite pastime for a dollar a
game. This saloon was likewise kept by two volunteers,
as was also the confectioner's by a fourth; so
that three of the most noted houses in the town were
rented by men, who, a few months before, scarcely possessed
any thing save their enterprise and their industry,
but who were now on the high road to opulence.
The more credit was due to them, and others of their
brethren whom fortune had similarly favored, because,
at first, they had deep-rooted prejudices to encounter,
which prudence and perseverance only could have
enabled them to overcome.</p>

<p>"I came next to the Square, or 'Plaza,' on one
side of which, and fronting it, stood the 'Miner's
Bank,' established by a Mr. Wright, a keen speculator,
who had secured possession of a large extent of
landed property, which he was turning to the very
best account. On the left of the Plaza, I noticed a
spacious-looking wooden building, two stories high,
called the 'Parker House;' but the handsome piazza
in front caused me to hesitate on the threshold; for I
apprehended&mdash;and not without reason&mdash;that, even in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
California, appearances must be paid for; as, therefore,
my purse was not overstocked, I prudently sought
a more modest establishment.</p>

<p>"I passed another hotel, similar to this one, but not
quite so large, and came presently to a low wooden
house, of most unattractive and unprepossessing exterior,
which was dignified by the name of the '<i>Café
Français</i>.' As this seemed likely to suit my present
convenience, and to promise a scale of prices on a par
with its external appearance, I entered boldly, and
seated myself at the dining-table. I noticed, as I went
in, that, notwithstanding the poverty without, there
was abundance within; the counter being literally
overcharged with French pastry, a variety of ingenious
culinary preparations, and some foreign liquors.</p>

<p>"After I had finished my repast, consisting of a
beef-steak, two eggs, and a couple of cups of coffee, I
prepared to depart. I specify the items of which my
repast was made up, because of the price I paid for
them&mdash;namely, two dollars and a half. I was informed,
on hazarding an observation respecting the amount,
that the charges were excessively moderate, any thing
in the shape of a dinner being usually charged one
dollar and fifty cents; half a dollar each for the eggs,
which were extras, was only a reasonable price for
such luxuries, as they frequently sold for double. I
considered the information thus obtained to be cheap,
of its kind, and went away with a mental reservation
not to eat any more eggs in California, unless they
were of another description than the golden ones.</p>

<p>"As I repassed the 'Parker House,' the <i>hotel, par
excellence</i>, of San Francisco, I went in, knowing that,
like all similar establishments, there were the usual
amusements going on within.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span></p>

<p>"This is not only the largest, but the handsomest
building in San Francisco; and, having been constructed
at enormous expense, and entirely on speculation,
a concurrence of fortunate circumstances alone,
such as had followed upon the discovery of the gold
mines, could have insured its prosperity. It was now
one of the most frequented, fashionable, and firmly
established hotels in the country; and, in so far as it
presented a model to the builders and settlers in the
town, was a signal illustration of the shrewdness and
enterprise of the Yankee character, and a standing
credit to the projectors and proprietors.</p>

<p>"It is built entirely of wood, and contains two very
spacious principal rooms; the one a dining-room, the
other set apart for billiards. Besides these, there are
three saloons of lesser dimensions, especially devoted
to gambling, and two well supplied bars&mdash;one below,
to the right of the entry, the other in the billiard-room.
The portion of the hotel that is not set apart
for the usual offices and conveniences is divided off
into innumerable chambers, which are occupied by the
superior classes of emigrants&mdash;lawyers, doctors, money-brokers,
<i>cum multis aliis</i>.</p>

<p>"The saloon contains two very handsome billiard-tables,
which are constantly occupied by players,
chiefly Americans, some of them of first-rate excellence.
The charge was a dollar per game of a hundred,
and they were no sooner vacated by one party than
another came in.</p>

<p>"The establishment contained nine gambling-tables,
which were crowded day and night, by the citizens
and the miners; many of the latter staking very large
sums upon the turn of a card. The stakes, however,
varied from twenty-five cents to five thousand dollars;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
and the excitement of some of the losers was frequently
fearful to contemplate. Some who gained largely
prudently withdrew; and I was informed that, a few
days previously to my arrival, a new-comer from the
States, who was bound for the mines, having come
into the saloon, and tried his fortune at the <i>monte</i>
tables, luckily made twenty thousand dollars, with
which he returned home, by the steamer, two days
afterwards.</p>

<p>"The 'Golden Eagle,' (<i>l'Aguila d'Oro</i>) is another
gambling establishment, situated in one of the streets
leading into the Plaza. It is a canvas house, about
fifty feet square, fitted up with the requisites for play,
and let out by the proprietor at the rate of fifteen
hundred dollars a month. Every available spot around
the tables was crowded to inconvenience by persons
who were engaged deeply in the game, the majority
standing up and watching the chances with countenances
betokening the greatest excitement.</p>

<p>"I now proceeded to the City Hotel, a large but
somewhat antiquated building, constructed of <i>adobé</i>,
after the Spanish fashion, but hybridized by American
improvements. The interior was even more insufferable
than the El Dorado, in respect of the boisterousness
of its frequenters. In the first room that I
entered were five gambling-tables, doing a 'smashing
business'&mdash;a term employed, somewhat in contradiction
to its import, to denote prosperity. The majority
of the players were Americans and other foreigners,
intermixed with a goodly number of Spaniards of the
lowest order. There was the same excitement, the
same recklessness, and the same trickery here, as at
the other gambling saloons, only infinitely more noise
and smoke, and swearing and inebriety.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span></p>

<p>"Here I met with another of the volunteers, who
proposing a walk, we went out together, and proceeded
to the Plaza. I found a good many old acquaintances
set up in business at this spot; one, who had been a
captain, had recently turned money-broker, and now
kept an office for the exchange of coin and gold-dust,
having entered into partnership with a highly respectable
and agreeable individual, of active business habits,
who promised to prove a great acquisition to the concern.</p>

<p>"We soon reached a low, long, <i>adobé</i> building,
situated at the upper side of the square, and which
my companion told me was the Custom House. To
the right of the Plaza stood the Saint Charles's
Hotel, a wooden edifice covered in with canvas, and
the Peytona House, an establishment of a similar
description, in both of which we did not fail to find
the usual games carried on.</p>

<p>"The streets leading down to the water-side contain
comparatively few hotels or eating-houses, they being
chiefly wood and canvas trading-stores. I observed
amongst them several newly opened auction and commission-rooms,
where goods were being put up, recommended
and knocked down in true Yankee style. An
immense number of wooden frame-houses in course of
erection met our view in every direction; and upon
remarking that many of them appeared to have been
purposely left incomplete, I ascertained that this arose
from the extreme difficulty of procuring lumber, which,
on account of its scarcity, occasionally fetched an incredibly
high price. A good deal of it is brought
from Oregon, and some from South America. Many
of the larger houses, but far inferior, notwithstanding,
to such of the same kind as could easily be procured
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
in New York at a rental of from 300 to 400 dollars
a-year, cost here at least 10,000 dollars to build them,
the lots on which they were erected being valued at
sums varying from 30,000 to 50,000 dollars, according
to the locality. Many spots of ground, just large
enough for a small trading-house or a tent to stand
upon, let at from 1200 to 2000 dollars.</p>

<p>"Amongst the various emigrants who daily flocked
into the city&mdash;for each day brought its fresh arrivals&mdash;were
numerous Chinese, and a very considerable
number of Frenchmen, from the Sandwich Islands
and from South America. The former had been
consigned, with houses and merchandise, to certain
Americans in San Francisco, to whom they were
bound by contract, as laborers, to work at a scale of
wages very far below the average paid to mechanics
and others generally. The houses they brought with
them from China, and which they set up where they
were wanted, were infinitely superior and more substantial
than those erected by the Yankees, being
built chiefly of logs of wood, or scantling, from six to
eight inches in thickness, placed one on the top of the
other, to form the front, rear, and sides; whilst the
roofs were constructed on an equally simple and ingenious
plan, and were remarkable for durability.</p>

<p>"These Chinese had all the air of men likely to
prove good citizens, being quiet, inoffensive, and particularly
industrious. I once went into an eating-house,
kept by one of these people, and was astonished
at the neat arrangement and cleanliness of the place,
the excellence of the table, and moderate charges. It
was styled the 'Canton Restaurant;' and so thoroughly
Chinese was it in its appointments, and in the manner
of service, that one might have easily fancied one's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
self in the heart of the Celestial Empire. The barkeeper&mdash;though
he spoke excellent English&mdash;was a
Chinese, as were also the attendants. Every article
that was sold, even of the most trifling kind, was set
down, in Chinese characters, as it was disposed of;
it being the duty of one of the waiters to attend to
this department. This he did very cleverly and
quickly, having a sheet of paper for the purpose, on
which the article and the price were noted down in
Chinese characters, by means of a long, thin brush,
moistened in a solution of Indian or Chinese ink. As
I had always been given to understand that these
people were of dirty habits, I feel it only right to
state that I was delighted with the cleanliness of this
place, and am gratified to be able to bear testimony
to the injustice of such a sweeping assertion.</p>

<p>"As for the French, they seemed entirely out of
their element in this Yankee town; and this circumstance
is not to be wondered at, when the climate and
the habits of the people are taken into consideration,
and also the strange deficiencies they must have
observed in the ordinary intercourse of life between
the citizens, so different from the polished address,
common even amongst the peasantry in their rudest
villages; to say nothing of the difficulty of carrying
on business amongst a people whose language they did
not understand. But their universal goal was the
mines; and to the mines they went, with very few
exceptions.</p>

<p>"Speaking of them reminds me of a '<i>Café Restaurant</i>,'
in San Francisco, kept by a very civil Frenchman,
and situated on the way to the Point. I mention
it, because I one day made here the most uncomfortable
repast it had ever been my lot to sit down to.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
Yet this was not owing to any lack of attention on the
part of the proprietor, to any inferiority in the quality
of his provisions, or to any deficiency of culinary skill
in their preparation; but simply to the prevalence of
the pest to which I have already alluded as invading
my own tent, namely, the dust. The house was built
chiefly of wood, and had a canvas roof, but this was
insufficient to keep out the impalpable particles with
which the air was charged, and which settled upon
and insinuated themselves into every article in the
place. There was dust on the counter, on the shelves,
on the seats, on the decanters, and in them; on the
tables, in the salt, on my beef-steak, and in my coffee.
There was dust on the polite landlord's cheeks, and in
his amiable wife's eyes, which she was wiping with the
corner of a dusty apron. I hurried my meal, and
was paying my score, when I caught sight of my own
face in a dusty-looking and dust-covered glass near
the bar, and saw that I too had become covered with
it, my entire person being literally encrusted with a
coat of powder, from which I experienced considerable
difficulty in cleansing myself.</p>

<p>"Notwithstanding all I had seen of San Francisco,
there yet existed here a world apart, that I should
never have dreamed of, but for my being one day
called upon to act upon a jury appointed to sit in
inquest over a person who had died there. This place
was called the 'Happy Valley.'</p>

<p>"Previously to our repairing thither, we attended
at the court-house, to take the usual oath. Proceeding
then through the lower part of the town, we
reached the beach, along which, by the water-side, we
walked for a distance of three miles&mdash;up to our ancles
in mud and sand&mdash;until we came to a spot where there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
were innumerable tents pitched, of all sizes, forms, and
descriptions, forming an irregular line stretching along
the shore for about two miles.</p>

<p>"The ground was, of course, low, damp, and muddy;
and the most unmistakeable evidences of discomfort,
misery, and sickness, met our view on every side, for
the locality was one of the unwholesomest in the
vicinity of the town. Yet here, to avoid the payment
of enormous ground-rents, and at the same time to
combine the advantage of cheap living, were encamped
the major portion of the most recently arrived emigrants,
and, amongst the rest, those of the ship
Brooklyn, on one of the passengers of which the inquest
was about to be held.</p>

<p>"This, then, was the 'Happy Valley;' a term no
doubt applied to it in derision, taking into consideration
the squalor, the discomfort, the filth, the misery,
and the distress that were rife there.</p>

<p>"I am satisfied that much of the crime and lawlessness
that is prevalent in California&mdash;particularly in
towns like San Francisco, where the ruder sex are
congregated exclusively and in large multitudes&mdash;is
attributable to the want of the humanizing presence of
women. In San Francisco there were about ten
thousand males, and scarcely a hundred females; for,
although in many parts of California the latter outnumber
the former, the national prejudice against
color was too strong for legitimate amalgamation to
take place."</p>

<p>Such was San Francisco soon after the discovery
of the riches of the Sacramento region. From an
insignificant settlement, sometimes the resort of
whaling-vessels, and of a few traders, it was quickly
transferred into a city, with an extensive and constantly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
increasing commerce. In its streets and
squares, erected where, just before, was a desert
plain, people of almost every nation were seen busily
engaged in traffic, or preparing for departure to the
gold region. It seemed the work of the enchanter.</p>

<p>Although, like San Francisco, <i>Monterey</i> was almost
deserted by its inhabitants upon the receipt of information
of the gold discovery, it soon began to give signs
of improvement. The bay, upon the shore of which
the town is located, is more exposed to the swell of
the sea, and to the north-west storms, than the Bay of
San Francisco, and therefore the harbor is inferior.
Yet Monterey received a considerable share of the tide
of emigration. Those who stopped there were generally
persons who intended to make a permanent
settlement, and engage in mercantile pursuits; and,
therefore, though the increase of the town was not so
rapid as that of San Francisco, it carried with it more
denotements of stability.</p>

<p>The town is situated on a short bend near the entrance
of the bay, upon its southern side. The point
of land which partly protects its harbor from the sea
is called Point Pinos. A very neat and pretty appearance
is presented by the houses of the native Californians,
which are generally constructed of <i>adobés</i> and
white-plastered. Those of the Americans are easily
distinguished by their being built of logs and planks,
and presenting a more substantial, but rougher appearance.
The town is surrounded by hills, covered with
lofty pine trees. Upon a height which overlooks the
town and harbor, a fort was built by the Americans
during the war with Mexico, and a military force continued
there till after the treaty of peace.</p>

<p>The country in the neighborhood of Monterey is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
fertile, and yields ample reward to the agriculturist.
There would, therefore, be no lack of supplies of provisions,
but for the indolence of the Californians,
owning the different <i>ranches</i> in the surrounding country.
From this cause, great scarcity of provisions of
all kinds is often the result. Notwithstanding the
additions made by Yankee enterprise and innovation,
the general manners and customs of the inhabitants
of Monterey retain all their old Spanish character;
and some of the customs of the natives, particularly
their amusements, are heartily joined in by the more
susceptible of the new-comers. The fandango and
the serenade with the guitar, still hold their sway as
freely and as undisturbed as in old Spain. The winters
are severely felt here. The rain causes torrents
of water to pour down from the hills in the rear of the
town, deluging the principal streets, and rendering
their passage almost impossible. During this period,
the only resort of the inhabitants for passing away the
time is the vice of gambling, in which they early
become adepts. This gambling propensity, noticed
among the Californians, induced a considerable number
of the initiated to emigrate from the United States,
and Monterey received a goodly proportion of them.
Such an increase of the population, however, could
not be considered desirable. Upon the whole, though
in a less degree, the effect of the golden attractions
of California could be seen at Monterey as at San
Francisco. Though it did not spring at once from a
small settlement to a large city, it was considerably
improved, and in 1849, it numbered more than a
thousand inhabitants.</p>

<p>A short distance south of Monterey, is the town of
<i>Santa Barbara</i>. Its situation is one of the most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
beautiful in California. It is built upon a plain ten
miles in extent. In front is a broad bay, having a
smooth beach of nearly thirty miles in extent. On
the right, towards the water, is a lofty eminence rising
nearly a thousand feet. Directly back of the town is
a range of almost impassable hills, running in a diagonal
direction. There is no harbor in the bay, and
vessels are obliged to anchor in an open roadstead;
and when the south-east winds prevail, they are in
constant peril.</p>

<p>The progress of the town was not much affected by
the gold mania. But though it offers no attractions
for mercantile or gold digging purposes, it has others
which will, no doubt, make it a favorite place of residence.
In 1849, it contained about one hundred and
fifty houses, built of <i>adobés</i>, and all one story in height.
The town is celebrated for being the residence of the
aristocracy of California, and for its beautiful women.
Its inhabitants are principally <i>rancheros</i>, who visit
their <i>ranches</i> two or three times in a year to see to
the marking and killing of their cattle, and then
spend the remainder of the year in the town, enjoying
life as much as possible. Indolence is the general
vice. A horse to ride, plenty to eat, and <i>cigaros</i> to
smoke constitute their <i>summum bonum</i>. Santa
Barbara is more celebrated for its fandangos than
any other town on the coast. These are open to all
comers, and constitute the general pastime of an evening.
The climate is mild and spring-like, and, independent
of the attractions in the town, the surrounding
country offers many of the most beautiful rides in
California. About a mile in the rear of the town, at
the top of a gentle slope, is the mission of Santa
Barbara, with its old, white walls and cross-mounted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
spires. The presiding priest of California resides
there, and a number of the converted Indians still
remain and cultivate the surrounding soil. The mission
is in a better condition than any other in the
country.</p>

<p><i>Ciudad de los Angeles</i>, or the City of the Angels,
is situated a hundred and ten miles south of Santa
Barbara, at the end of an immense plain, extending
from the city twenty-five miles, to San Pedro, its port.
This is the garden spot of California. Before the
discovery of the gold mines, the City of the Angels
was the largest town in the country. It contains about
two thousand inhabitants, most of whom are wealthy
<i>rancheros</i>, who dwell there to cultivate the grape. As
in all the towns of California, the houses are constructed
of <i>adobé</i> and covered with asphaltum, which
is found in great quantities near the town. The
northern section is laid out in streets, and is occupied
by the trading citizens; the southern section is made
up of gardens, vinyards and orchards, which are made
extremely productive by irrigating the soil with the
water of a large stream running through them. Many
acres of ground are covered with vines, which, being
trimmed every year, are kept about six feet in height.
In the fall of the year, these vines are burdened with
rich clusters of grapes; and, in addition to these,
great quantities of fruit of various kinds are raised.
The surrounding country abounds with game of all
kinds. In the rainy season, millions of ducks and
geese cover the plains between Los Angeles and San
Pedro, while the neighboring hills abound with quails,
deer, elk, and antelope. The vineyards produce such
quantities of grapes, that many thousand barrels of
wine and <i>aguardiente</i>&mdash;the brandy of the country&mdash;are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
annually manufactured. The wine is of various
kinds; some of it being equal to the best produced in
Europe.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of the City of the Angels, being
generally of the wealthy class of Californians, have
always strongly adhered to the institutions of Mexico.
They offered the most strenuous resistance to the
American forces at the time of the conquest of California,
but were vanquished in two battles, and the
city taken. All the customs and amusements peculiar
to the Spaniards and the countries which they colonized,
are here in full vogue. Music, dancing, singing,
slaughtering cattle, or gambling, are the usual
pastimes of the inhabitants. Yet, with these trifling
occupations, attachment to the Roman Catholic church
and a careful observance of its ceremonies, is characteristic
of all. Upon the tolling of the bell, gaming,
swearing, dancing&mdash;every thing is stopped while the
prescribed prayer is muttered, and then all go on as
before.</p>

<p>Though Los Angeles did not experience any increase
of population consequent upon the flood of emigration
to California, its delightful climate and its fertile soil
are gradually procuring it such consideration as will
doubtless lead to the filling up of the surrounding
country.</p>

<p><i>San Diego</i> is the most southern town of Upper
California. It is situated on the coast, three miles
north of the line separating Upper and Lower California.
The harbor is inferior only to that of San Francisco.
It is perfectly sheltered by land from the gales
at all seasons of the year. Vessels can lie within a
cable's length of the beach, there being no surf running
upon it. The town is situated about three miles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
from the beach, and is about the same size as Santa
Barbara. It is a place of far greater facilities and
promise, however, than the last mentioned town. San
Diego has always been the most important depot for
hides, upon the coast; and there is no doubt that an
extensive inland trade will be carried on between it
and the towns in the interior, as the region of the
Colorado and the Gila becomes settled. Since the
conquest of Upper California and the discovery of the
gold, the progress of the town has been rapid. From
being an inconsiderable settlement sustained principally
by a mission, which had early been established
there, it has become a town of great commercial
promise. The climate being mild and pleasant, and
the surrounding country abounding in game and
adapted for grazing, thus making provisions abundant,
San Diego is a very desirable place of residence.</p>

<p>The town of San José is situated in a fertile valley,
near the most southern extremity of the Bay of San
Francisco. On the south of the town runs a small
stream, and the place is surrounded by plains, affording
fine pasturage. Being situated on the direct
route from the southern ports to the gold mines, San
José received a considerable stimulus from their discovery.
A profitable trade was soon established, and
the town improved very rapidly. It is now a town of
about four thousand inhabitants, and the increase still
continues rapid. In a greater degree than any of the
older towns of California, it has all the evidence of a
thriving and progressive place. The greater part of
the buildings are constructed in a style which shows
the inroads of the taste of the people from the Atlantic
States. A number of Mormons settled here at an
early period, and built a great many neat wooden
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
houses and cottages, which contrast favorably with
the heavy old <i>adobés</i> residences of the native inhabitants.
Flour and saw-mills have been erected,
but the scarcity of water is severely felt by their proprietors.</p>

<p>San José in respect to climate and general abundance
of the necessaries and luxuries of life, is one
of the most desirable places of residence in California.
Though situated a short distance inland, and thus
deprived of the facilities which contributed to the
rapid growth of San Francisco, the fertile plain surrounding
it, and the increase of the inland trade and
travel will draw to the town and its neighborhood a
thriving, business population. The old mission of
San José is situated about ten miles from the town.
The establishment and the grounds belonging to it are
in a state of decay. The population there is about
three hundred in number, most of whom are Indians,
and all of them in a degraded condition.</p>

<p>The emigration to the gold region caused many
towns to spring up, as if by magic, in its neighborhood,
and on the route to it from San Francisco. These
were principally the stopping places of the gold-seekers,
or the seat of a trade in provisions and articles manufactured
in the States and transported thither. Some
of these towns have become of a size sufficient to warrant
the assertion that they will soon rival the cities
of the Atlantic coast of the United States. The progress
of these places is aided by the enormous price
of real estate in San Francisco.</p>

<p>One of the most promising of the new towns is called
Benicia. It is situated on the Strait of Carquinez,
thirty-five miles north of San Francisco. The strait
forms the entrance of Suisan into Pablo Bay. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
site of Benicia is a gentle slope, which, descending to
the water, becomes almost a plain. Vessels of the
first class can lie at anchor at its bank, and discharge
their cargoes, and the harbor is safe from violent
winds. The town has been made the head-quarters of the
Pacific division of the United States army, and a site
for a navy-yard has been selected by Commodore Jones.
The marks of governmental favor show in what estimation
the position of Benicia is held. The town was
laid out in 1848, by Robert Semple and Thomas O.
Larkin. Early in 1850, lots were selling at very high
rates, and the population numbered more than a
thousand persons.</p>

<p>Between Benicia and Sacramento city, several towns
have been laid out, all in very favorable positions.
The principal are&mdash;Martinez, on the southern shore of
the strait of Carquinez, nearly opposite Benicia; New
York of the Pacific, at the junction of the River San
Joaquin with the Bay of Suisan; Suisan, on the west
bank of the Sacramento, at a distance of eighty miles
from San Francisco.</p>

<p>Next to San Francisco, Sacramento is the largest
city in California. It is situated on the eastern bank
of the Sacramento River, one hundred miles from San
Francisco, and sixty-five from Suisan Bay. It is
located on a beautiful plain, which is not elevated more
than ten or twelve feet above the river at low water.
This being insufficient to protect it from the rise of
the waters of the river, several disastrous floods have
occurred during the existence of the city. Up to this
point, the river is navigable for large class steamers.
Ships drawing not more than twelve feet of water may
go up that far at all seasons; and, besides these
commercial advantages, Sacramento is the natural
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
trading depot for the richest portion of the mining
regions.</p>

<p>Where the city of Sacramento now stands, at the
time of the gold discovery, there stood, "solitary and
alone," a small fort. This formed the nucleus, about
which, at the commencement of the rush of emigration,
the town soon sprang into existence. Its increase
has been almost as rapid as that of San Francisco.
During the rainy season of the early part of 1850,
the population numbered somewhere between twenty
and thirty thousand. But at that period, a considerable
portion of the gold-diggers made Sacramento and
the other towns in the neighborhood of the mines,
their resort, to escape the severity of spending the
season at the open and exposed valleys of the gold
region. The city is regularly laid out, but its appearance
evidences the rapidity of its erection. The
greater number of the houses and stores in the neighborhood
of the river are constructed of wood, while
the outskirts, particularly upon the south, are occupied
by the tents of the constantly-arriving overland emigrants.
Before the commencement of the last rainy
season, the number of these emigrants reached two or
three thousand. They squatted upon the vacant lots
which had been surveyed and sold to other persons.
This caused a considerable agitation in the town, which
continued till the disastrous flood swept both the parties
off the ground, and thus left the field clear for
another commencement. Sacramento is the grand
receptacle of the overland emigration, and this, combined
with its commercial facilities, will continue to
give the city a superiority over the majority of the
other places in California.</p>

<p>Adjoining Sacramento city, is the town of Sutter.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
It is situated on the highest and healthiest ground on
the river. It is not, like Sacramento, subject to an
annual overflow. The town was originally laid out
by Captain Sutter and others; and is owned by Hon.
John McDougall, Lieutenant-Governor of California,
and Captain Sutter. It has a thriving business population,
and its position, and the fertility of the neighboring
country will soon make it a place of importance.</p>

<p>Stockton is to the southern portion of the gold
region what Sacramento is to the northern. It is
situated upon a slough, or a succession of sloughs, containing
the back waters formed by the junction of the
San Joaquin and Sacramento Rivers. It is about
fifty miles from the mouth of the San Joaquin, and
one hundred from San Francisco. The ground upon
which it is situated is high and is not subject to overflow.
Vessels drawing nine feet water can ascend the
San Joaquin as far as Stockton, and discharge their
cargoes on the bank. In the latter part of 1848, the
town was laid out and a frame building erected by
Charles M. Weber. In eight months from that time,
it contained a population of about two thousand permanent
residents, and a large number of temporary
residents, on their road to the mines. Communication
is with San Francisco by means of steamboats and
launches, and the commerce of the town is constantly
increasing.</p>

<p>Other towns exist&mdash;on paper&mdash;in the neighborhood
of San Francisco and the gold region, and, doubtless,
they will, in the course of time, become settled by a
thriving, go-ahead population from the Atlantic States.
Land speculation in California is as profitable a
business as gold-digging&mdash;and less toilsome. Many of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
the shrewd ones, who early took advantage of this
"tide in the affairs of men," have already reached the
goal of their hopes, an independent fortune. Those
who saw how things would turn out, and purchased
land in the neighborhood of the region which promised
to receive the principal current of the emigration to
California, found themselves wealthy in the short
space of a few months.</p>

<p>The great influx of emigrants to Upper California
has brought the subject of the settlement of the peninsula
into consideration. There is but little doubt that
Lower California will, sooner or later, become the
property of the United States, and then its settlement
and progress will be rapid. The coast upon the gulf
affords many excellent harbors, and the mountainous
region of the interior gives abundant evidence of
mineral wealth, as far as it has been explored. Several
silver mines have been opened in different places, the
principal of which are at San Antonio, between La
Paz and Cape San Lucas. Near Loretto, the first
settlement in California, extensive copper mines have
been opened, and lead and iron abound in all directions.
The pearl fishery of the gulf has already
yielded an enormous wealth, having been prosecuted
from the time of the discovery of the peninsula. The
fishing season lasts from May till November, and
more than a hundred vessels are yearly engaged in
the business. These resources, despite the general
unfitness of the country for agricultural purposes, will
soon attract their full share of consideration, and
cause an influx of emigrants and adventurers from the
United States and other countries. Some portions
of the country are susceptible of irrigation, and
might thus be rendered fit for cultivation.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span></p>

<p>The principal port of Lower California is La Paz,
situated near the mouth of the gulf. The bay on the
shore of which the town is located, is of great extent
and beauty, and possesses a large number of rich
pearl oyster-beds&mdash;the pearl fishery having at one
time supplied the chief article of traffic on this part
of the coast. The country around the bay is elevated
and picturesque, though rugged; the soil being composed
principally of rock and sand, wildly and irregularly
covered with the most prickly species of
stunted bushes and shrubs of sunburnt hue. The
town of La Paz is neatly built and presents a pretty
appearance. The streets are lined with willow trees,
and these meeting overhead, form a delicious shade
during the heat of the day. The houses are all constructed
of <i>adobés</i>, plastered white, and thatched with
the leaves of the palm tree. The beach is lined with
palms, cocoa-nut, fig and tamarind trees. La Paz
was taken by the American volunteers during the
war with Mexico, and considerable destruction of the
orchards, gardens and houses of the town was the
consequence. The harbor offers great advantages for
a naval station, and such, doubtless, it will become.</p>

<p>San José, the most southern town of Lower California,
is situated about half-way between Cape San
Lucas and Cape Palmo, on a sort of desert plain,
extending from the beautiful valley of San José to the
ocean. It is located about three miles from the beach,
and is one of the strangest creations in the shape of a
town imaginable.</p>

<p>The heavy rains and freshets which occur in the
wet season, in this region, render every elevation invaluable
as a preservative against the dangers of sudden
inundations; hence all the houses are built upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
steeps, rocks, and hillocks, necessarily irrespective of
order; so that, even in the most densely populated
districts, barren hills, as yet unoccupied by dwellings,
are frequently to be met with, with deep hollows in
every part, converting mere visits into positive enterprises,
in most instances both tedious and disagreeable.
To these great natural disadvantages, the indolence
of the inhabitants has added others, their common
practice being to dig for <i>adobé</i> clay at the nearest
convenient spot, namely, for the most part, opposite
their own doors; thus, one would imagine that the
site of the whole town had been visited and disturbed
by a succession of miniature earthquakes, which, whilst
they had left the houses themselves unshaken, had
heaved and perched them up in the most uncomfortable
positions, and in the most inaccessible places. In
the very centre of the principal street, which appears
to have once upon a time been level, are three or four
immense clay-pits, serving as a receptacle for dead
dogs, cats, bones, vegetable refuse, and, in a word,
every description of rubbish and nuisance a very dirty
population can convey to or discharge in them.</p>

<p>But a description of the town would be incomplete
without adding that it is dotted about in these hollows,
and in the sand-holes in the rocks, with patches of
thorn, brush, and cacti, forming a singular yet refreshing
contrast with the general barrenness of the region
itself, the whole being surrounded by a bleak mountainous
range, which increases in elevation until it
blends with the clear sky, far in the distance.</p>

<p>The principal, indeed the only regular street in
the town, is wide and long, the houses being constructed
of <i>adobés</i> and cane, thatched with palm leaves.
It is blocked up at the remoter end by the fort, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
stands upon a wide foundation of rock of considerable
elevation; various portions of the <i>adobé</i> walls connecting
the crags having been pierced, so as to allow
artillery to be trained through the embrasures, whilst,
in other parts, there are numerous loop-holes for
musketry. There are some very awkward cavities
amongst these rocks, produced by digging for clay for
the <i>adobé</i> work. The fort is flat-roofed and parapetted,
having portholes for cannon; and below, in
the very centre of the building, occupying about a third
of its entire length, runs a thick wall, forming a crescent,
well mounted with heavy guns. At the end of
this crescent, between it and the front wall, is the
entrance to the fort&mdash;a mere aperture, barely wide
enough to allow of one man's passing in.</p>

<p>These defences proved to be of great advantage to
a small party of Americans that landed at San José,
during the war between the United States and Mexico,
and were compelled to take shelter in the old quartel,
or barracks. There they were surrounded by the
Californians, and stood a siege of several weeks',
suffering incredible hardships. The population of San
José numbers about three thousand, the majority being
semi-Indians, or the pure descendants of the Mexicans.
There is little promise of any considerable increase in
the size of the town, owing to the natural disadvantages
of situation.</p>

<p>The other towns of Lower California are&mdash;San
Antonio, in the neighborhood of an extensive silver
mine, which has been worked for a long time with
considerable profit; Loreto, on the gulf coast, about
two hundred miles north of La Paz; San Domingo
and Todos Santos, on the Pacific coast. The latter
town is situated on the bay of the same name, and is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
the most northerly part of Lower California. The
church and mission buildings at this place are the
largest and most imposing structures of the kind in
Lower California. The church has a handsome front
and a lofty steeple. The mission is the residence of
the head of the church in Lower California. There
is every reason to believe, that, when the richer portions
of Upper California begin to get a little crowded,
the tide of emigration will be turned to the south, and
the ports of the peninsula will become of great commercial
importance. Then, if not before, the country
will become the property of the United States, either
by way of purchase, or after the manner of Texas.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<p class="center p2">
THE FORMATION OF A STATE GOVERNMENT.</p>

<p class="p2">The state of things which induced the people of
California to form a state government deserves to be
fully set forth. Their condition was without precedent
in history; and from a statement of that condition,
it will be seen that the framing of a constitution
and the organization of a state government was the
only resource of the Californians. The representations
of the report of Thomas Butler King to the government
of the United States will not be contradicted,
and these we insert.</p>

<p>"The discovery of the gold mines had attracted a
very large number of citizens of the United States to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
that territory, who had never been accustomed to
any other than American law, administered by American
courts. There they found their rights of property
and person subject to the uncertain, and frequently
most oppressive, operation of laws written in a language
they did not understand, and founded on principles,
in many respects, new to them. They complained
that the alcaldes, or judges, most of whom had been
appointed or elected before the immigration had commenced,
were not lawyers by education or profession;
and, being Americans, they were, of course, unacquainted
with the laws of Mexico, or the principles of
the civil law on which they are founded.</p>

<p>"As our own laws, except for the collection of
revenue, the transmission of the mails, and establishment
of postoffices, had not been extended over that
territory, the laws of Mexico, as they existed at the
conclusion of the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, regulating
the relations of the inhabitants of California
with each other, necessarily remained in force;<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> yet,
there was not a single volume containing those laws,
as far as I know or believe, in the whole territory,
except, perhaps, in the governor's office at Monterey.</p>

<p>"The magistrates, therefore, could not procure
them, and the administration of justice was, necessarily,
as unequal and fluctuating as the opinions of
the judges were conflicting and variable.</p>

<p>"There were no fee-bills to regulate costs; and,
consequently, the most cruel exactions, in many instances,
were practised.</p>

<p>"The greatest confusion prevailed respecting titles
to property, and the decision of suits involving the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
most important rights, and very large sums of money
depended upon the dictum of the judge.</p>

<p>"The sale of the territory by Mexico to the United
States had necessarily cut off or dissolved the laws
regulating the granting or procuring titles to land;
and, as our own land-laws had not been extended over
it, the people were compelled to receive such titles as
were offered to them, without the means of ascertaining
whether they were valid or not.</p>

<p>"Litigation was so expensive and precarious that
injustice and oppression were frequently endured,
rather than resort to so uncertain a remedy.</p>

<p>"Towns and cities were springing into existence;
many of them without charters or any legal right to
organize municipal authorities, or to tax property or
the citizens for the establishment of a police, the
erection of prisons, or providing any of those means
for the protection of life and property which are so
necessary in all civil communities, and especially
among a people mostly strangers to each other.</p>

<p>"Nearly one million and a half of dollars had been
paid into the custom-house, as duties on imported
goods, before our revenue laws had been extended over
the country; and the people complained bitterly that
they were thus heavily taxed without being provided
with a government for their protection, or
laws which they could understand, or allowed the
right to be represented in the councils of the
nation.</p>

<p>"While anxiously waiting the action of Congress,
oppressed and embarrassed by this state of affairs, and
feeling the pressing necessity of applying such remedies
as were in their power, and circumstances seemed
to justify, they resolved to substitute laws of their own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
for the existing system, and to establish tribunals for
their proper and faithful administration.</p>

<p>"In obedience, therefore, to the extraordinary
exigencies of their condition, the people of the city of
San Francisco elected members to form a legislature,
and clothed them with full powers to pass laws.</p>

<p>"The communities of Sonoma and of Sacramento
city followed the example.</p>

<p>"Thus were three legislative bodies organized; the
two most distant being only one hundred and thirty
miles apart.</p>

<p>"Other movements of the kind were threatened,
and doubtless would have followed, in other sections
of the territory, had they not been arrested by the
formation of a State government.</p>

<p>"While the people of California were looking to
Congress for a territorial government, it was quite
evident that such an organization was daily becoming
less suited to their condition, which was entirely different
from that of any of the territories out of which
the new States of the Union had been formed.</p>

<p>"Those territories had been at first slowly and
sparsely peopled by a few hunters and farmers, who
penetrated the wilderness, or traveled the prairies,
in search of game or a new home; and, when thus
gradually their population warranted it, a government
was provided for them. They, however, had no foreign
commerce, nor any thing beyond the ordinary pursuits
of agriculture, and the various branches of business
which usually accompany it, to induce immigration
within their borders. Several years were required to
give them sufficient population and wealth to place
them in a condition to require, or enable them to support,
a State government.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span></p>

<p>"Not so with California. The discovery of the
vast metallic and mineral wealth in her mountains had
already attracted to her, in the space of twelve months,
more than one hundred thousand people. An extensive
commerce had sprung up with China, the ports of
Mexico on the Pacific, Chili, and Australia.</p>

<p>"Hundreds of vessels from the Atlantic ports of
the Union, freighted with our manufactures and
agricultural products, and filled with our fellow-citizens,
had arrived, or were on their passage round
Cape Horn; so that, in the month of June last, (1849)
there were more than three hundred sea-going vessels
in the port of San Francisco.</p>

<p>"California has a border on the Pacific of ten degrees
of latitude, and several important harbors which
have never been surveyed; nor is there a buoy, a
beacon, a lighthouse, or a fortification, on the whole
coast.</p>

<p>"There are no docks for the repair of national or
mercantile vessels nearer than New York, a distance
of some twenty thousand miles round Cape Horn.</p>

<p>"All these things, together with the proper regulations
for the gold region, the quicksilver mines, the
survey and disposition of the public lands, the adjustment
of land titles, the establishment of a mint and
of marine hospitals, required the immediate formation
of a more perfect civil government than California
then had, and the fostering care of Congress and the
Executive.</p>

<p>"California had, as it were by magic, become a
State of great wealth and power. One short year
had given her a commercial importance but little
inferior to that of the most powerful of the old States.
She had passed her minority at a single bound, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
might justly be regarded as fully entitled to take her
place as an equal among her sisters of the Union.</p>

<p>"When, therefore, the reality became known to the
people of that territory that the government had done
nothing to relieve them from the evils and embarrassments
under which they were suffering, and seeing no
probability of any change on the subject which divided
Congress, they adopted, with most unexampled unanimity
and promptitude, the only course which lay
open to them&mdash;the immediate formation of a State
government.</p>

<p>"They were induced to take this step not only for
the reason that it promised the most speedy remedy
for present difficulties, but because the great and
rapidly growing interests of the territory demanded
it; and all reflecting men saw, at a glance, that it
ought not to be any longer, and could not, under any
circumstances, be much longer postponed.</p>

<p>"They not only considered themselves best qualified,
but that they had the right to decide, as far as they
were concerned, the embarrassing question which was
shaking the Union to its centre, and had thus far
deprived them of a regularly organized civil government.
They believed that, in forming a constitution,
they had a right to establish or prohibit slavery, and
that, in their action as a <i>State</i>, they would be sustained
by the North and the South.</p>

<p>"In taking this step, they proceeded with all the
regularity which has ever characterized the American
people in discharging the great and important duties
of self-government.</p>

<p>"The steamer in which I was a passenger did not
stop at Monterey; I therefore did not see General
Riley, nor had I any communication with him until
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
about the middle of the month, when he came to San
Francisco. A few days after my arrival, his proclamation
calling a Convention to form a State constitution,
<i>dated the third of June</i>, was received.</p>

<p>"The people acted in compliance with what they
believed to be the views of Congress, and conformably
to the recommendations of the proclamation; and proceeded,
on the day appointed, to elect members to a
Convention for the purpose of forming a constitution,
to be regularly submitted to the people for their ratification
or rejection, and, if approved, to be presented
to Congress, with a prayer for the admission of California,
as a State, into the Union."</p>

<p>According to the recommendation of General Riley,
the civil governor of California, an election of delegates
to form a Convention was held on the 1st of August,
1849. The number of delegates to be elected was
thirty-seven. General Riley, General Smith, and
Thomas Butler King, used every means to stimulate
the people to hold the preparatory meetings, and they
were generally successful. But in some districts
scarcely any move was made until a few days before
the election. In one or two instances, the election
was not held upon the day appointed; but the Convention
nevertheless admitted the delegates elected in
such cases.</p>

<p>The Convention was to meet on the 1st of September,
at Monterey; but it did not get regularly organized
until the 4th of that month, when Dr. Robert
Semple, of the Sonoma district, was chosen president.
The proportion of the native Californian members to
the American was about equal to that of the population.
Among the members was Captain John Sutter,
the pioneer settler of California, General Vallejo and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
Antonio Pico, who had both been distinguished men
in California, before the conquest. The body, as a
whole, commanded respect, as being dignified and
intellectual.</p>

<p>The Declaration of Rights was the first measure
adopted by the Convention. Its sections being general
and liberal in their character, were nearly all adopted
by a unanimous vote. The clause prohibiting the
existence of slavery was the unanimous sentiment of
the Convention. The Constitution will be found in
another part of this work, and we will not here recapitulate
its provisions. It combines the best features of the
Constitutions of the States east of the Rocky Mountains,
and is in most respects similar to that of the
State of New York.</p>

<p>The most exciting questions discussed were, a clause
prohibiting the entrance of free people of color into
the State, the boundary line, and the great seal of
the State. The first, the clause prohibiting the
entrance of free people of color into the State,
passed first reading, but was subsequently rejected
by a large majority. The question of suffrage occasioned
some discussion, widely differing opinions
being entertained by the members. An article was
adopted by the Convention, excluding Indians and
negroes, with their descendants, from the privilege of
voting; but it was subsequently modified by a proviso,
which gave the Legislature power of admitting Indians,
or the descendants of Indians to the right of suffrage
by a two-thirds concurrent vote. Under this provision,
some of the most wealthy and influential Californians
are excluded from voting until permitted by the
Legislature.</p>

<p>The boundary question, which came up towards the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
close of the Convention, was the most exciting theme.
The point of dispute was the eastern boundary line.
The Pacific formed the natural boundary on the west;
the parallel of 42 degrees, the boundary on the north,
and the Mexican line, run in conformity with the
treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, the boundary on the
south. The discussion, reconsideration and voting
upon the various propositions occupied nearly two
days. Finally, the line detailed in the Constitution
was adopted.</p>

<p>The discussion upon the adoption of the Great Seal
for the State was amusing. Eight or ten designs were
offered, and the members from the different districts
were all anxious to have their particular district represented.
The choice finally fell upon one offered by a
Major Garnett. The principal figure is Minerva, with
spear and shield, emblematic of the manner in which
California was born, full-grown, into the confederacy.
At her feet crouches the grizzly bear. Before him is
the wheat-sheaf and vine, illustrating the agricultural
products of the country. Near them is the miner,
with his implements. In the distance is the Bay of
San Francisco, and beyond that, the Sierra Nevada,
over which appears the word "Eureka." The closing
scenes of the Convention are described in graphic and
vivid colors by one who was an eye-witness to them,
and recorded them upon the spot.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>"The members met this morning at the usual hour,
to perform the last duty that remained to them&mdash;that
of signing the Constitution. They were all in the
happiest humor, and the morning was so bright and
balmy that no one seemed disposed to call an organization.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
Mr. Semple was sick, and Mr. Steuart, of
San Francisco, therefore called the meeting to order
by moving Captain Sutter's appointment in his place.
The chair was taken by the old pioneer, and the members
took their seats around the sides of the hall,
which still retained the pine-trees and banners, left
from last night's decorations. The windows and doors
were open, and a delightful breeze came in from the
bay, whose blue waters sparkled in the distance. The
view from the balcony in front was bright and inspiring.
The town below&mdash;the shipping in the harbor&mdash;the
pine-covered hills behind&mdash;were mellowed by the blue
October haze, but there was no cloud in the sky, and
I could plainly see, on the northern horizon, the
mountains of Santa Cruz and the Sierra de Gavilan.</p>

<p>"After the minutes had been read, the Committee
appointed to draw up an Address to the people of
California, was called upon to report, and Mr. Steuart,
Chairman, read the Address. Its tone and sentiment
met with universal approval, and it was adopted without
a dissenting voice. A resolution was then offered
to pay Lieutenant Hamilton, who is now engaged in
engrossing the Constitution upon parchment, the sum
of $500 for his labor. This magnificent price, probably
the highest ever paid for a similar service, is on a
par with all things else in California. As this was
their last session, the members were not disposed to
find fault with it, especially when it was stated by one
of them that Lieutenant Hamilton had written day
and night to have it ready, and was still working
upon it, though with a lame and swollen hand. The
sheet for the signer's names was ready, and the Convention
decided to adjourn for half an hour and then
meet for the purpose of signing.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span></p>

<p>"I amused myself during the interval by walking
about the town. Every body knew that the Convention
was about closing, and it was generally understood
that Captain Burton had loaded the guns at the
fort, and would fire a salute of thirty-one guns at the
proper moment. The citizens, therefore, as well as
the members, were in an excited mood. Monterey
never before looked so bright, so happy, so full of
pleasant expectation.</p>

<p>"About one o'clock the Convention met again; few
of the members, indeed, had left the hall. Mr. Semple,
though in feeble health, called them to order, and,
after having voted General Riley a salary of $10,000,
and Mr. Halleck, Secretary of State, $6000 a year,
from the commencement of their respective offices,
they proceeded to affix their names to the completed
Constitution. At this moment a signal was given;
the American colors ran up the flag-staff in front of
the government buildings, and streamed out on the
air. A second afterward the first gun boomed from
the fort, and its stirring echoes came back from one
hill after another, till they were lost in the distance.</p>

<p>"All the native enthusiasm of Captain Sutter's
Swiss blood was aroused; he was the old soldier again.
He sprang from his seat, and, waving his hand around
his head, as if swinging a sword, exclaimed; 'Gentlemen,
this is the happiest day of my life. It makes
me glad to hear those cannon: they remind me of the
time when I was a soldier. Yes, I am glad to hear
them&mdash;this is a great day for California!' Then,
recollecting himself, he sat down, the tears streaming
from his eyes. The members with one accord, gave
three tumultuous cheers, which were heard from one
end of the town to the other. As the signing went
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
on, gun followed gun from the fort, the echoes reverberating
grandly around the bay, till finally, as the
loud ring of the <i>thirty-first</i> was heard, there was a
shout: 'That's for California!' and every one joined
in giving three times three for the new star added to
our Confederation.</p>

<p>"There was one handsome act I must not omit to
mention. The captain of the English bark Volunteer,
of Sidney, Australia, lying in the harbor, sent on shore
in the morning for an American flag. When the first
gun was heard, a line of colors ran fluttering up to the
spars, the stars and stripes flying triumphantly from
the main-top. The compliment was the more marked,
as some of the American vessels neglected to give any
token of recognition to the event of the day.</p>

<p>"The Constitution having been signed and the Convention
dissolved, the members proceeded in a body
to the house of General Riley. The visit was evidently
unexpected by the old veteran. When he made his
appearance, Captain Sutter stepped forward, and
having shaken him by the hand, drew himself into an
erect attitude, raised one hand to his breast as if he
were making a report to his commanding officer on the
field of battle, and addressed him as follows:</p>

<p>"'<span class="smcap">General</span>: I have been appointed by the delegates,
elected by the people of California to form a
Constitution, to address you in their names and in
behalf of the whole people of California, and express
the thanks of the Convention for the aid and coöperation
they have received from you in the discharge of
the responsible duty of creating a State government.
And, sir, the Convention, as you will perceive from
the official records, duly appreciates the great and
important services you have rendered to our common
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
country, and especially to the people of California,
and entertains the confident belief that you will receive
from the whole of the people of the United States,
when you retire from your official duties here, that
verdict so grateful to the heart of the patriot: 'Well
done, thou good and faithful servant.'</p>

<p>"General Riley was visibly affected by this mark
of respect, no less appropriate than well deserved on
his part. The tears in his eyes, and the plain, blunt
sincerity of his voice and manner, went to the heart
of every one present. 'Gentlemen,' he said, 'I
never made a speech in my life. I am a soldier&mdash;but
I can <i>feel</i>; and I do feel deeply the honor you have
this day conferred upon me. Gentlemen, this is a
prouder day to me than that on which my soldiers
cheered me on the field of Contreras. I thank you
all from my heart. I am satisfied now that the people
have done right in selecting delegates to frame a Constitution.
They have chosen a body of men upon
whom our country may look with pride; you have
framed a Constitution worthy of California. And I
have no fear for California while her people choose
their representatives so wisely. Gentlemen, I congratulate
you upon the successful conclusion of your
arduous labors; and I wish you all happiness and
prosperity.'</p>

<p>"The General was here interrupted with three hearty
cheers which the members gave him, as Governor of
California, followed by three more, 'as a gallant soldier,
and worthy of his country's glory.' He then concluded
in the following words: 'I have but one thing
to add, gentlemen, and that is, that my success in the
affairs of California is mainly owing to the efficient
aid rendered me by Captain Halleck, the Secretary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
of State. He has stood by me in all emergencies.
To him I have always appealed when at a loss myself;
and he has never failed me.'</p>

<p class="caption">RANCHE&mdash;UPPER CALIFORNIA.</p>
</div>

<p>"This recognition of Captain Halleck's talents and
the signal service he has rendered to our authorities
here, since the conquest, was peculiarly just and appropriate.
It was so felt by the members, and they
responded with equal warmth of feeling by giving
three enthusiastic cheers for the Secretary of State.
They then took their leave, many of them being anxious
to start this afternoon for their various places of residence.
All were in a happy and satisfied mood, and
none less so than the native members. Pedrorena
declared that this was the most fortunate day in the
history of California. Even Carillo, in the beginning
one of our most zealous opponents, displayed a genuine
zeal for the Constitution, which he helped to frame
under the laws of our republic."</p>

<p>The elections for the various officers under the new
Constitution took place on the 13th of November,
1849. Peter H. Burnett was chosen Governor, and
John McDougall, Lieutenant-Governor. George W.
Wright and Edward Gilbert were chosen to fill the
posts of representatives in Congress. The first State
Legislature met at the capital, the pueblo de San
José, on the 15th of December, and elected John C.
Fremont and Wm. M. Gwin, Senators to Congress.
Every branch of the civil government went at once
into operation, and admission into the Union as a
State seems all that is necessary to complete the settlement
of affairs in California.

<p class="center p2">
POPULATION, CLIMATE, PRODUCTIONS, &amp;C.
</p>

<p class="p2">With regard to the population, climate, soil, productions,
&amp;c., we extract from Mr. King's Report, as
giving the most reliable and complete information.</p>

<p>"Humboldt, in his 'Essay on New Spain,' states
the population of Upper California, in 1802, to have
consisted of</p>

<table summary="Population of Upper California, Humboldt">
<tr>
<td>Converted Indians,</td>

<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td class="tdr">16,862</td>

</table>

<p>"Alexander Forbes, in his 'History of Upper and
Lower California,' published in London, in 1839, states
the number of converted Indians in the former to have been,
in 1831,</p>

<table summary="Population of Upper California, Forbes">

</table>

<p>"He expresses the opinion that this number had
not varied much up to 1835, and the probability is,
there was very little increase in the white population
until the emigrants from the United States began to
enter the country in 1838.</p>

<p>"They increased from year to year, so that, in
1846, Colonel Fremont had little difficulty in calling
to his standard some five hundred fighting men.</p>

<p>"At the close of the war with Mexico, it was supposed
that there were, including discharged volunteers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
from ten to fifteen thousand Americans and Californians,
exclusive of converted Indians, in the territory.
The immigration of American citizens in 1849, up to
the 1st of January last, was estimated at eighty thousand&mdash;of
foreigners, twenty thousand.</p>

<p>"The population of California may, therefore, be
safely set down at 115,000 at the commencement of
the present year.</p>

<p>"It is quite impossible to form any thing like an
accurate estimate of the number of Indians in the territory.
Since the commencement of the war, and
especially since the discovery of gold in the mountains,
their numbers at the missions, and in the valleys near
the coast, have very much diminished. In fact, the
whole race seems to be rapidly disappearing.</p>

<p>"The remains of a vast number of villages in all
the valleys of the Sierra Nevada, and among the foot-hills
of that range of mountains, show that at no distant
day there must have been a numerous population,
where there is not now an Indian to be seen. There
are a few still retained in the service of the old Californians,
but these do not amount to more than a few
thousand in the whole territory. It is said there are
large numbers of them in the mountains and valleys
about the head-waters of the San Joaquin, along the
western base of the Sierra, and in the northern part
of the territory, and that they are hostile. A number
of Americans were killed by them during the last
summer, in attempting to penetrate high up the rivers
in search of gold; they also drove one or two parties
from Trinity River. They have, in several instances,
attacked parties coming from or returning to Oregon,
in the section of country which the lamented Captain
Warner was examining when he was killed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span></p>

<p>"It is quite impossible to form any estimate of the
number of these mountain Indians. Some suppose
there are as many as three hundred thousand in the
territory, but I should not be inclined to believe that
there can be one-third of that number. It is quite
evident that they are hostile, and that they ought to
be chastised for the murders already committed.</p>

<p>"The small bands with whom I met, scattered
through the lower portions of the foot-hills of the
Sierra, and in the valleys between them and the coast,
seemed to be almost the lowest grade of human beings.
They live chiefly on acorns, roots, insects, and the
kernel of the pine burr; occasionally, they catch fish
and game. They use the bow and arrow, but are said
to be too lazy and effeminate to make successful hunters.
They do not appear to have the slightest inclination
to cultivate the soil, nor do they even attempt
it&mdash;as far as I could obtain information&mdash;except when
they are induced to enter the service of the white
inhabitants. They have never pretended to hold any
interest in the soil, nor have they been treated by the
Spanish or American immigrants as possessing any.</p>

<p>"The Mexican government never treated with them
for the purchase of land, or the relinquishment of any
claim to it whatever. They are lazy, idle to the last
degree, and, although they are said to be willing to
give their services to any one who will provide them
with blankets, beef, and bread, it is with much difficulty
they can be made to perform labor enough to
reward their employers for these very limited means
of comfort.</p>

<p>"Formerly, at the missions, those who were brought
up and instructed by the priests made very good servants.
Many of these now attached to families seem
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
to be faithful and intelligent. But those who are at
all in a wild and uncultivated state are most degraded
objects of filth and idleness.</p>

<p>"It is possible that government might, by collecting
them together, teach them, in some degree, the arts
and habits of civilization; but, if we may judge of the
future from the past, they will disappear from the face
of the earth as the settlements of the whites extend
over the country. A very considerable military force
will be necessary, however, to protect the emigrants in
the northern and southern portions of the territory."</p>

<p>So much for the population of California at the
commencement of the present year, (1850.) By its
close, it is highly probable, the number will reach two
hundred thousand, exclusive of the Indians. Such a
population, composed, for the most part, of those who
are impregnated with the active, progressive spirit of
the American people, will undoubtedly conduct California
to a brilliant position among the stars of the
republic. With regard to the climate of the country,
various conflicting statements have been promulgated,
which arises from the visits of those who make the
statements having been made to different portions of
the country, and stating the climate of a portion as
the climate of the whole. Mr. King's Report furnishes
the most accurate account of the changes of
the temperature, and the state of the atmosphere
throughout the year, together with an explanation of
their causes. He says&mdash;</p>

<p>"I come now to consider the climate. The climate
of California is so remarkable in its periodical changes,
and for the long continuance of the wet and dry seasons,
dividing, as they do, the year into about two
equal parts, which have a most peculiar influence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
on the labor applied to agriculture and the products
of the soil, and, in fact, connect themselves so inseparably
with all the interests of the country, that I deem
it proper briefly to mention the causes which produce
these changes, and which, it will be seen, as this report
proceeds, must exercise a controlling influence on the
commercial prosperity and resources of the country.</p>

<p>"It is a well-established theory, that the currents
of air under which the earth passes in its diurnal
revolutions, follow the line of the sun's greatest attraction.
These currents of air are drawn towards this
line from great distances on each side of it; and, as
the earth revolves from west to east, they blow from
north-east and south-east, meeting, and, of course,
causing a calm, on the line.</p>

<p>"Thus, when the sun is directly, in common parlance,
over the equator, in the month of March, these
currents of air blow from some distance north of the
Tropic of Cancer, and south of the Tropic of Capricorn,
in an oblique direction towards this line of the
sun's greatest attraction, and forming what are known
as the north-east and south-east trade winds.</p>

<p>"As the earth, in its path round the sun, gradually
brings the <i>line</i> of attraction north, in summer, these
currents of air are carried <i>with</i> it; so that about the
middle of May the current from the north-east has
extended as far as the 38th or 39th degree of north
latitude, and by the twentieth of June, the period of
the sun's greatest northern inclination, to the northern
portions of California and the southern section of
Oregon.</p>

<p>"These north-east winds, in their progress across
the continent, towards the Pacific Ocean, pass over
the snow-capped ridges of the Rocky Mountains and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
the Sierra Nevada, and are, of course, deprived of all
the moisture which can be extracted from them by the
low temperature of those regions of eternal snow, and
consequently no moisture can be precipitated from
them, in the form of dew or rain, in a higher temperature
than that to which they have been subjected.
They, therefore, pass over the hills and plains of
California, where the temperature is very high in
summer, in a very dry state; and, so far from being
charged with moisture, they absorb, like a sponge, all
that the atmosphere and surface of the earth can yield,
until both become, apparently, perfectly dry.</p>

<p>"This process commences, as I have said, when the
line of the sun's greatest attraction comes north in
summer, bringing with it these vast atmospheric
movements, and, on their approach, produce the dry
season in California; which, governed by these laws,
continues until some time after the sun repasses the
Equator in September, when, about the middle of
November, the climate being relieved from these north-east
currents of air, the south-west winds set in from
the ocean charged with moisture&mdash;the rains commence
and continue to fall, not constantly, as some persons
have represented, but with sufficient frequency to
designate the period of their continuance, from about
the middle of November until the middle of May, in
the latitude of San Francisco, as the <i>wet season</i>.</p>

<p>"It follows, as a matter of course, that the <i>dry
season</i> commences first, and continues longest in the
southern portions of the territory, and that the climate
of the northern part is influenced in a much less
degree, by the causes which I have mentioned, than
any other section of the country. Consequently, we
find that, as low down as latitude 39°, rains are sufficiently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
frequent in summer to render irrigation quite
unnecessary to the perfect maturity of any crop which
is suited to the soil and climate.</p>

<p>"There is an extensive ocean current of cold water,
which comes from the northern regions of the Pacific,
or, perhaps, from the Arctic, and flows along the
coast of California. It comes charged with, and emits
in its progress, cold air, which appears in the form of
fog when it comes in contact with a higher temperature
on the American coast, as the gulf-stream of the
Atlantic exhales vapor when it meets, in any part of
its progress, a lower temperature. This current has
not been surveyed, and, therefore, its source, temperature,
velocity, width, and course, have not been accurately
ascertained.</p>

<p>"It is believed, by Lieutenant Maury, on what he
considers sufficient evidence&mdash;and no higher authority
can be cited&mdash;that this current comes from the coasts
of China and Japan, flows northwardly to the peninsula
of Kamtschatka, and, making a circuit to the
eastward, strikes the American coast in about latitude
41° or 42°. It passes thence southwardly, and finally
loses itself in the tropics.</p>

<p>"Below latitude thirty-nine, and west of the foot-hills
of the Sierra Nevada, the forests of California
are limited to some scattering groves of oak in the
valleys and along the borders of the streams, and of
red wood on the ridges and in the gorges of the hills&mdash;sometimes
extending into the plains. Some of the
hills are covered with dwarf shrubs, which may be
used as fuel. With these exceptions, the whole
territory presents a surface without trees or shrubbery.
It is covered, however, with various species
of grass, and, for many miles from the coast, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
wild oats, which, in the valleys, grow most luxuriantly.
These grasses and oats mature and ripen early in the
dry season, and soon cease to protect the soil from
the scorching rays of the sun. As the summer advances,
the moisture in the atmosphere and the earth
to a considerable depth, soon becomes exhausted;
and the radiation of heat, from the extensive naked
plains and hill-sides, is very great.</p>

<p>"The cold, dry currents of air from the north-east,
after passing the Rocky Mountains and the Sierra
Nevada, descend to the Pacific, and absorb the moisture
of the atmosphere, to a great distance from the
land. The cold air from the mountains, and that
which accompanies the great ocean current from the
north-west, thus become united; and vast banks of
fog are generated, which, when driven by the wind
has a penetrating, or <i>cutting</i>, effect on the human
skin, much more uncomfortable than would be felt in
the humid atmosphere of the Atlantic, at a much
lower temperature.</p>

<p>"As the sun rises from day to day, week after week,
and month after month, in unclouded brightness during
the dry season, and pours down its unbroken rays
on the dry, unprotected surface of the country, the
heat becomes so much greater inland than it is on the
ocean, that an under-current of cold air, bringing the
fog with it, rushes over the coast range of hills, and
through their numerous passes, towards the interior.</p>

<p>"Every day, as the heat, inland, attains a sufficient
temperature, the cold, dry wind from the ocean commences
to blow. This is usually from eleven to one
o'clock: and, as the day advances, the wind increases
and continues to blow till late at night. When the
vacuum is filled, or the equilibrium of the atmosphere
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
restored, the wind ceases; a perfect calm prevails
until about the same hour the following day, when
the same process commences and progresses as before;
and these phenomena are of daily occurrence,
with few exceptions, throughout the dry season.</p>

<p>"These cold winds and fogs render the climate at
San Francisco, and all along the coast of California,
except the extreme southern portion of it, probably
more uncomfortable, to those not accustomed to it, in
summer than in winter.</p>

<p>"A few miles inland, where the heat of the sun
modifies and softens the wind from the ocean, the
climate is moderate and delightful. The heat, in the
middle of the day, is not so great as to retard labor
or render exercise in the open air uncomfortable.
The nights are cool and pleasant. This description
of climate prevails in all the valleys along the coast
range, and extends throughout the country, north and
south, as far eastward as the valley of the Sacramento
and San Joaquin. In this vast plain, the sea-breeze
loses its influence, and the degree of heat in the
middle of the day, during the summer months, is
much greater than is known on the Atlantic coast in
the same latitudes. It is dry, however, and probably
not more oppressive. On the foot-hills of the Sierra
Nevada, and especially in the deep ravines of the
streams, the thermometer frequently ranges from
110° to 115° in the shade, during three or four hours
of the day, say from eleven until three o'clock. In
the evening, as the sun declines, the radiation of heat
ceases. The cool, dry atmosphere from the mountains
spreads over the whole country, and renders the
nights cool and invigorating.</p>

<p>"I have been kindly furnished, by Surgeon-General
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
Lawson, U.S. Army, with thermometrical observations,
taken at the following places in California,
viz: At San Francisco, by Assistant-Surgeon W. C.
Parker, for six months, embracing the last quarter of
1847 and the first quarter of 1848. The monthly
mean temperature was as follows: October, 57°;
November, 49°; December, 50°; January, 49°;
February, 50°; March, 51°.</p>

<p>"At Monterey, in latitude 36° 38' north and longitude
121° west, on the coast, about one degree and a
half south of San Francisco, by Assistant-Surgeon
W. S. King, for seven months, from May to November
inclusive. The monthly mean temperature was:
May, 56°; June, 59°; July, 62°; August, 59°; September,
58°; October, 60°; November, 56°.</p>

<p>"At Los Angeles, latitude 34° 7', longitude west
118° 7', by Assistant-Surgeon John S. Griffin, for
ten months, from June, 1847, to March, 1848, inclusive.
The monthly mean temperature was: June,
73°; July, 74°; August, 75°; September, 75°;
October, 69°; November, 59°; December, 60°;
January, 58°; February, 55°; March, 58°. This
place is about forty miles from the coast.</p>

<p>"At San Diego, latitude 32° 45', longitude west
117° 11', by Assistant-Surgeon J. D. Summers, for
the following three months of 1849, viz: July,
monthly mean temperature, 73°; August 75°; September,
70°.</p>

<p>"At Suttersville, on the Sacramento River, latitude
38° 32' north, longitude west 121° 34', by Assistant-Surgeon
R. Murray, for the following months of 1849:
July, monthly mean temperature, 73°; August, 70°;
September, 65°; October, 65°.</p>

<p>"These observations show a remarkably high temperature
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
at San Francisco during the six months from
October to March inclusive; a variation of only
eight degrees in the monthly mean, and a mean
temperature for the six months of 51 degrees.</p>

<p>"At Monterey, we find the mean monthly temperature
of the seven months to have been 58°. If we
take the three summer months, the mean heat was 60°.
The mean of the three winter months was a little over
49°; showing a mean difference, on that part of the
coast, of only 11° between summer and winter.</p>

<p>"The mean temperature of San Francisco, for the
three winter months, was precisely the same as at
Monterey&mdash;a little over 49°.</p>

<p>"As these cities are only one degree and a half
distant from each other, and both situated near the
ocean, the temperature at both, in summer, may very
reasonably be supposed to be as nearly similar as the
thermometer shows it to be in winter.</p>

<p>"The mean temperature of July, August, and September,
at San Diego, only 3° 53' south of Monterey,
was 72°. The mean temperature of the same months
at Monterey was a little over 59°; showing a mean
difference of 13°.</p>

<p>"This would seem to indicate that the cold ocean
current is thrown off from the southern part of the
coast by Point Conception, and the islands south of
it; and consequently its influence on the climate of
San Diego is much less than at Monterey and San
Francisco.</p>

<p>"At Los Angeles, 40 miles distant from the coast,
the mean temperature of the three months was 74°;
of the three autumn months, 67°; of the three
winter months, 57°.</p>

<p>"At Suttersville, about one hundred and thirty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
miles from the ocean, and four degrees north of Los
Angeles, the mean temperature of August, September,
and October, was 67°. The mean temperature
of the same months at Monterey was 59°; showing a
difference of 8° between the sea-coast and the interior,
on nearly the same parallel of latitude. A much
greater difference would undoubtedly appear, if we
had observations for the spring and summer months
of Suttersville and the gold mines.</p>

<p>"These variations in the climate of California account
for the various and conflicting opinions and
statements respecting it.</p>

<p>"A stranger arriving at San Francisco in summer is
annoyed by the cold winds and fogs, and pronounces
the climate intolerable. A few months will modify,
if not banish his dislike, and he will not fail to appreciate
the beneficial effects of a cool, bracing atmosphere.
Those who approach California overland,
through the passes of the mountains, find the heat of
summer, in the middle of the day, greater than they
have been accustomed to, and, therefore, may complain
of it.</p>

<p>"Those who take up their residence in the valleys
which are situated between the great plain of the
Sacramento and San Joaquin and the coast range of
hills, find the climate, especially in the dry season, as
healthful and pleasant as it is possible for any climate
to be which possesses sufficient heat to mature the cereal
grains and edible roots of the temperate zone.</p>

<p>"The division of the year into two distinct seasons&mdash;dry
and wet&mdash;impresses those who have been accustomed
to the variable climate of the Atlantic
States unfavorably. The dry appearance of the
country in summer, and the difficulty of moving about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
in winter, <i>seem</i> to impose serious difficulties in the
way of agricultural prosperity, while the many and
decided advantages resulting from the mildness of
winter, and the bright, clear weather of summer, are
not appreciated. These will appear when I come to
speak of the productions of California. We ought
not to be surprised at the dislike which the immigrants
frequently express to the climate. It is so unlike
that from which they come, that they cannot readily
appreciate its advantages, or become reconciled to its
extremes of dry and wet.</p>

<p>"If a native of California were to go to New
England in winter, and see the ground frozen and
covered with snow, the streams with ice, and find
himself in a temperature many degrees colder than
he had ever felt before, he would probably be as much
surprised that people could or would live in so inhospitable
a region, as any immigrant ever has been
at what he has seen or felt in California.</p>

<p>"So much are our opinions influenced by early impressions,
the vicissitudes of the seasons with which
we are familiar, love of country, home, and kindred,
that we ought never to hazard a hasty opinion when
we come in contact with circumstances entirely different
from those to which we have all our lives been
accustomed."</p>

<p>These remarks explain the reason of the diversity
of opinion expressed by persons who have visited
California, in a very satisfactory manner. The Italian
climate of Los Angeles has received the praises of
nearly all who have visited that city or its neighborhood.
The thermometrical observations detailed in
the above account seem to prove that much of the unfavorable
opinions expressed concerning the climate is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
the result of hasty judgment, and a dislike of that
which is different from that to which we have been
used.</p>

<p>The soil of California has also been the subject of
various and conflicting statements. Many of those
who have spent some months in the country, and returned
to publish their hastily gathered observations,
either set down the soil as totally unfit for agricultural
purposes, or, having been located in some garden spot
the great portion of their time of residence there, pronounce
it unsurpassed for richness and fertility. As
Mr. King visited California with the sole object of
making accurate observations upon the territory and
its resources, the statements of the character of the
soil which are given in his report will carry greater
weight than any other. He says&mdash;</p>

<p>"The valleys which are situated parallel to the
coast range, and those which extend eastwardly in all
directions among the hills, towards the great plain of
the Sacramento, are of unsurpassed fertility.</p>

<p>"They have a deep black alluvial soil, which has
the appearance of having been deposited when they
were covered with water. This idea is strengthened
by the fact that the rising grounds on the borders of
these valleys, and many hills of moderate elevation,
have a soil precisely like that of the adjoining plains.</p>

<p>"This soil is so porous that it remains perfectly unbroken
by gullies, notwithstanding the great quantity
of water which falls in it annually during the wet
season. The land in the northern part of the territory,
on the Trinity and other rivers, and on the borders
of Clear Lake, as far as it has been examined, is
said to be remarkably fertile.</p>

<p>"The great valley of the Sacramento and San
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
Joaquin has evidently been, at some remote period,
the bed of a lake; and those rivers, which drain it,
present the appearance of having cut their channels
through the alluvial deposit after it had been formed.
In fact, it is not possible that they could have been
instrumental in forming the plain through which they
pass. Their head-waters come from the extreme ends
of the valley, north and south; and, were it not for
the supply of water received from the streams which
flow into them from the Sierra Nevada, their beds
would be almost, if not quite, dry in the summer
months. The soil is very rich, and, with a proper
system of drainage and embankment, would, undoubtedly,
be capable of producing any crop, except sugar-cane,
now cultivated in the Atlantic States of the
Union.</p>

<p>"There are many beautiful valleys and rich hill-sides
among the foot-hills of the Sierra Nevada, which,
when the profits of labor in mining shall be reduced
so as to cause its application to agriculture, will probably
support a large population. There is said to
be a rich belt of well-timbered and watered country
extending the whole length of the gold region between
it and the Sierra Nevada, some twenty miles in width.
There is no information sufficiently accurate respecting
the eastern slope of the great snowy range to
enable us to form any opinion of its general character
or soil. Some of its valleys have been visited by
miners, who represent them as equal to any portion
of the country to the westward of it.</p>

<p>"The great valley of the Colorado, situated between
the Sierra Madre and the Sierra Nevada, is but little
known. It is inhabited by numerous tribes of savages,
who manifest the most decided hostility towards the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
whites, and have hitherto prevented any explorations
of their country, and do not permit emigrants to pass
through it. Therefore, parties from Santa Fé, on
their way to California, are compelled to make a circuit
of near a thousand miles northward to the Salt
Lake, or about the same distance southward by the
route of the Gila. Although this valley is little known,
there are indications that it is fertile and valuable.</p>

<p>"The name of the river 'Colorado' is descriptive
of its waters; they are as deeply colored as those of
the Missouri or Red River, while those of the Gila,
which we know flows through barren lands, are clear.</p>

<p>"It would seem impossible for a large river to collect
sediment enough in a sandy, barren soil, to color
its waters so deeply as to give it a name among those
who first discovered and have since visited its shores.
The probability, therefore, is, that this river flows
through an alluvial valley of great fertility, which has
never been explored. This conjecture is strengthened
by the fact that the Indians who inhabit it are hostile,
and oppose, as far as they can, all persons who attempt
to enter or explore it. This has been their uniform
course of conduct respecting all portions of the continent
which have been fertile, abounding in game and
the spontaneous productions of the earth.</p>

<p>"As this valley is situated in the direct route from
Santa Fé to California, its thorough exploration becomes
a matter of very great importance, especially
as it is highly probable that the elevated regions to
the north of it, covered with snow during most of the
year, will force the line of the great national railway
to the Pacific through some portion of it.</p>

<p>"The soil I have described, situated west of the
Sierra Nevada, and embracing the plain of the Sacramento
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
and San Joaquin, covers an area, as nearly as
I can estimate, of between fifty and sixty thousand
square miles, and would, under a proper system of
cultivation, be capable of supporting a population
equal to that of Ohio or New York at the present
time."</p>

<p>If this account be accurate, the soil of California
will yield a rich reward to the agriculturist, and become
a strong attraction to permanent settlers, who
are willing to trust to the more certain returns for
labor spent in tilling it. It is agriculture, undoubtedly,
which must give stability to the increase of the country,
and, whatever may be the value of the gold mines,
furnish California with her substantial wealth. Few
cities or towns ever had a permanent prosperity which
had not a neighboring country fit for agricultural
purposes.</p>

<p>The quantity and quality of the present productions
of California, other than her mineral wealth, is an
important subject for inquiry. Previous to the discovery
of the gold, the exportable products consisted
almost exclusively of hides and tallow; the inhabitants
paying more attention to the raising of horses and
cattle than to the cultivation of the soil. The reason
is found in the general characteristic of the Californians&mdash;indolence.
Horses were raised to gratify
their passion for riding; and cattle, because they
afforded a subsistence at a very small cost of labor.
As to what are, and what, by the character of the
soil and climate, might be, the products of California,
and how the wants of the people are to be supplied,
we quote Mr. King's remarks:</p>

<p>"Beef cattle, delivered on the navigable waters of
the Bay of San Francisco, are now worth from $20 to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
$30 per head; horses, formerly worth from $5 to
$10, are now valued at $60 to $150. The destruction
of cattle for their hides and tallow has now entirely
ceased, in consequence of the demand for beef. This
demand, will, of course, increase with the population;
and it would seem that, in a very few years, there
will be none to supply the market.</p>

<p>"If we estimate the number of cattle now in California
at 500,000 head, which is believed to be about
the number, and the population at 120,000 for the year
1850&mdash;a low estimate&mdash;and suppose it to increase one
hundred thousand per annum, there will be in the
Territory or State, in 1854, five hundred and twenty
thousand people.</p>

<p>"If we adopt the estimate of those well acquainted
with the demand, of half a beef, on an average, to
each inhabitant, it appears there will be a consumption,
in 1850, of 60,000 head; in 1851, of 110,000;
in 1852, of 160,000; in 1853, of 210,000; in 1854,
of 260,000&mdash;making an aggregate of 800,000, which
would absorb all the present stock, with its natural
increase.</p>

<p>"This is a very important matter, as connected with
the amount of supply which that country will ultimately
require from the Atlantic States of the Union. There
is no other country on earth which has, or will ever
possess, the means of supplying so great a demand.</p>

<p>"It is now a well-established fact among the immigrants
to California, that oxen possess greater powers
of endurance than mules or horses; that they will
perform the distance with loaded wagons in less time,
and come in at the end of the journey in better condition.</p>

<p>"Cows are now driven in considerable numbers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
from Missouri, and the time cannot be far distant
when cattle from the Western States will be driven
annually by tens of thousands to supply this new
market.</p>

<p>"If California increases in population as fast as
the most moderate estimate would lead us to believe,
it will not be five years before she will require more
than one hundred thousand head of beef cattle per
annum, from some quarter, to supply the wants of her
people.</p>

<p>"It must not be supposed that salt provisions may
supply this vast demand. Those who have attempted
to live on such food, during the dry season, have been
attacked with scurvy and other cutaneous diseases, of
which many have died.</p>

<p>"There is no climate in the world where fresh meat
and vegetables are more essential to human health.
In fact, they are indispensable.</p>

<p>"It must not be inferred that cattle driven across
the plains and mountains, from the Western States,
will be fit for beef on their arrival in California. But
one winter and spring, on the luxuriant pastures of
that country, will put them in a condition which would
render them acceptable in any Atlantic market.</p>

<p>"These grazing grounds are extensive enough to
support five times as many cattle as may be <i>annually</i>
required; therefore, there will be no scarcity of food
for them.</p>

<p>"I am acquainted with a drover who left California
in December last, with the intention of bringing in
ten thousand sheep from New Mexico. This shows
that the flocks and herds east of the Rocky Mountains
are looked to already as the source from which the
markets on the Pacific are to be supplied.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span></p>

<p>"The climate and soil of California are well suited
to the growth of wheat, barley, rye, and oats. The
temperature along the coast is too cool for the successful
culture of maize as a field crop. The fact that
oats, the species which is cultivated in the Atlantic
States, are annually self-sowed and produced on all
the plains and hills along the coast, and as far inland
as the sea-breeze has a marked influence on the climate,
is sufficient proof that all the cereal grains may be
successfully cultivated without the aid of <i>irrigation</i>.</p>

<p>"It is quite true that <i>this auxiliary</i> was extensively
employed at the missions, and undoubtedly increased
the product of all crops to which it was applied, as it
will in any country on earth if skilfully used. This
does not prove, however, that it was <i>essentially necessary</i>
to the production of an ample reward to the
husbandman. The experience of all the old inhabitants
is sufficient evidence of this. If their imperfect
mode of culture secured satisfactory returns, it is
reasonable to presume that a more perfect system
would produce much greater results. There is abundant
evidence to prove that, in the rich alluvial valleys,
wheat and barley have produced from forty to sixty
bushels from one bushel of seed, <i>without irrigation</i>.</p>

<p>"Irish potatoes, turnips, onions, in fact all the edible
roots known and cultivated in the Atlantic States, are
produced in great perfection. In all the valleys east
of the coast range of hills, the climate is sufficiently
warm to mature crops of Indian corn, rice, and probably
tobacco.</p>

<p>"The cultivation of the grape has attracted much
attention at the missions, among the residents of
towns, and the rural population, and been attended
with much success, wherever it has been attempted.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
The dry season secures the fruit from those diseases
which are so fatal in the Atlantic States, and it attains
very great perfection.</p>

<p>"The wine made from it is of excellent quality, very
palatable, and can be produced in any quantity. The
grapes are delicious, and produced with very little
labor. When taken from the vines in bunches, and
suspended in a dry room by the stems, they become
partially dry, retain their flavor, and remain several
weeks, perhaps months, without decay.</p>

<p>"Apples, pears, and peaches are cultivated with
facility, and there is no reason to doubt that all the
fruits of the Atlantic States can be produced in great
plenty and perfection.</p>

<p>"The grasses are very luxuriant and nutritious,
affording excellent pasture. The oats, which spring
up the whole length of the sea-coast, and from forty
to sixty miles inland, render the cultivation of that
crop entirely unnecessary, and yield a very great
quantity of nutritious food for horses, cattle, and
sheep. The dry season matures, and I may say
cures, these grasses and oats, so that they remain in
an excellent state of preservation during the summer
and autumn, and afford an ample supply of forage.
While the whole surface of the country appears
parched, and vegetation destroyed, the numerous flocks
and herds which roam over it continue in excellent
condition.</p>

<p>"Although the mildness of the winter months, and
the fertility of the soil, secure to California very
decided agricultural advantages, it is admitted that
<i>irrigation</i> would be of very great importance, and
necessarily increase the products of the soil, in quantity
and variety, during the greater part of the dry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
season. It should, therefore, be encouraged by
government, in the survey and disposition of the
public lands, as far as practicable.</p>

<p>"The farmer derives some very important benefits
from the dry season. His crops in harvest time are
never injured by rain; he can with perfect confidence
permit them to remain in his fields as long after they
have been gathered as his convenience may require;
he has no fears that they will be injured by wet or
unfavorable weather. Hence it is that many who
have long been accustomed to that climate prefer it to
the changeable weather east of the Rocky Mountains.</p>

<p>"As already stated, the forests of California, south
of latitude 39°, and west of the foot-hills of the
Sierra Nevada, are limited to detached, scattering
groves of oak in the valleys, and of red wood on the
ridges and on the gorges of the hills.</p>

<p>"It can be of no practical use to speculate on the
causes which have denuded so large an extent of country,
further than to ascertain whether the soil is or is
not favorable to the growth of forest trees.</p>

<p>"When the dry season sets in, the entire surface is
covered with a luxuriant growth of grass and oats,
which, as the summer advances, become perfectly dry.
The remains of all dead trees and shrubs also become
dry. These materials, therefore, are very combustible,
and usually take fire in the latter part of summer and
beginning of autumn, which commonly passes over the
whole country, destroying, in its course, the young
shrubs and trees. In fact, it seems to be the same
process which has destroyed or prevented the growth
of forest trees on the prairies of the Western States,
and not any quality in the soil unfriendly to their
growth.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span></p>

<p>"The absence of timber and the continuance of the
dry season are apt to be regarded by farmers, on first
going into the country, as irremediable defects, and as
presenting obstacles, almost insurmountable, to the
successful progress of agriculture. A little experience
will modify these opinions.</p>

<p>"It is soon ascertained that the soil will produce
abundantly without manure; that flocks and herds
sustain themselves through the winter without being
fed at the farm-yard, and, consequently, no labor is
necessary to provide forage for them; that ditches are
easily dug, which present very good barriers for the
protection of crops, until live fences can be planted,
and have time to grow. Forest trees may be planted
with little labor, and in very few years attain a sufficient
size for building and fencing purposes. Time
may be usefully employed in sowing various grain and
root crops during the wet or winter season. There is
no weather cold enough to destroy root crops, and,
therefore, it is not necessary to gather them. They
can be used or sold from the field where they grow.
The labor, therefore, required in most of the old
States to fell the forests, clear the land of rubbish,
and prepare it for seed, may here be applied to other
objects.</p>

<p>"All these things, together with the <i>perfect security
of all crops in harvest time, from injury by wet
weather</i>, are probably sufficient to meet any expense
which may be incurred in irrigation, or caused, for a
time, by a scanty supply of timber.</p>

<p>"In the northern part of the territory, above latitude
39°, and on the hills which rise from the great
plain of the Sacramento and San Joaquin to the foot
of the Sierra Nevada, the forests of timber are beautiful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
and extensive, and would, if brought into use, be
sufficiently productive to supply the wants of the
southern and western portions of the State."</p>

<p>It is not to be expected that the labor and attention
necessary for the improvement of the soil will be given
to that object, so long as the continued discovery
of gold and other metals promise an easy road to
wealth. Many who were prosperously engaged in
agricultural employments, in the most fertile regions,
have abandoned it, lured by the golden bait, and
shouldered the pick and shovel to try their luck or
perseverance at gold digging. The gardens and the
vineyards of Los Angeles have been deserted for the
barren hills and ravines where the precious dust
abounds. In this state of things, California must
become an extensive market for the products of the
Atlantic States of the Union.</p>

<p>The extent and value of the public domain, and
the validity of the titles to various tracts of land in
California, will, doubtless, be the cause of much litigation
and disturbance, as the country becomes more
thickly settled. The relation in which the claimants of
land granted to them under the Mexican government,
stand towards the government of the United States,
is clearly and fully set forth by Mr. King, in his California
report. He says&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is not known whether the Jesuits who founded
the mission, or their successors the Franciscans, ever
did, or do now, hold any title from the Spanish crown
to the lands which they occupied. Nor has any investigation
been made to ascertain how far those
titles, if they ever existed, have been invalidated by
the acts of the priests, or the decrees of the Mexican
government.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span></p>

<p>"A superficial view of the matter would be very apt
to lead to the supposition that the Jesuits, so celebrated
for wisdom and cunning, would not fail to
secure that which, at that time, would probably have
been obtained by merely asking for it&mdash;a royal decree,
granting to them all the lands they might require in
that remote country for ecclesiastical purposes. There
have been some intimations to that effect, but nothing
is distinctly known. These missions embrace within
their limits some of the most valuable lands in the
Territory, and it is very important that it should be
ascertained whether they belong to the Government,
or may be justly claimed by individuals.</p>

<p>"Most of the land fit for cultivation, south of latitude
39°, and west of the valley of the Sacramento
and San Joaquin, is claimed under what purport to
be grants from the Mexican government.</p>

<p>"On most of these grants, the minerals and metals
are reserved to the government: conditions were
coupled with many of them which have not been complied
with. In others, the boundaries described embrace
two or three times as much land as the grant
conveys.</p>

<p>"The Mexican law required all grants made by the
provincial government, with few exceptions, to be
confirmed by the supreme government. The great
distance which separated them, and the unfrequent or
difficult means of communication, made a compliance
with the law so expensive and tardy that it came to be
almost disregarded.</p>

<p>"There were other causes which led to this neglect.</p>

<p>"Previous to the treaty with Mexico and the immigration
of American citizens to that country, land
was not regarded as of much value, except for grazing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
purposes. There was room enough for all. Therefore,
the claimants or proprietors did not molest one
another, or inquire into the validity of titles.</p>

<p>"These extensive grants are described by natural
boundaries, such as mountains, bays, and promontories,
which, in many instances, might allow of a variation
of several miles in the establishment of a corner with
chain and compass.</p>

<p>"By the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, the United
States purchased all the rights and interests of
Mexico to and in California. This purchase not only
embraced all the lands which had not been granted
by Mexico, but all the reserved minerals and metals,
and also reversionary rights which might accrue to
Mexico from a want of compliance on the part of the
grantees with the conditions of their grants, <i>or a want
of perfection in the grants</i>.</p>

<p>"It will be perceived that this is a subject of very
great importance, not only to the people of California,
but to the United States, and calls for prompt and
efficient action on the part of the Government. It is
believed that the appointment of competent commissioners,
fully empowered to investigate these titles, in
a spirit of kindness towards the claimants, with
power to confirm such titles as justice may seem to
demand, or with instructions to report their proceedings
and awards to Congress, for confirmation or
rejection, will be the best and perhaps the only satisfactory
mode of adjusting this complex and difficult
question."</p>

<p>He also makes the following observations and recommendations
concerning the extent and value of
the land, to which the title of the government is unquestionable,
and the best mode of improving it.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span></p>

<p>"The lands in the northern part of the Territory,
above the 39°, have not been explored or granted.
They are supposed to embrace an area of about twenty
millions of acres, a large portion of which is doubtless
valuable for its timber and soil.</p>

<p>"Comparatively few grants have been obtained in
the great valley of the Sacramento and San Joaquin.</p>

<p>"This vast tract, therefore, containing, as is estimated,
from twelve to fifteen millions of acres, belongs
mostly to the Government. South of this valley, and
west of the Colorado, within the limits of California,
as indicated in her Constitution, there are said to be
extensive tracts of valuable, unappropriated land;
and, on investigation, it will probably appear that
there are many of them in detached bodies, which
have not been granted.</p>

<p>"I do not speak of the gold region, embracing the
entire foot-hills of the Sierra Nevada, some five
hundred miles long and sixty miles broad, in connection
with the public domain, which may be embraced
in the general land system for sale and settlement,
for reasons which will be hereafter assigned.</p>

<p>"The survey of the public lands on a system suited
to the interests of the country is a matter of very
great importance. In the inhabited portions of the
Territory, the boundaries of Mexican grants, running
as they do in all directions, will render the system of
surveys by parallels of latitude and longitude quite
impracticable.</p>

<p>"In all parts of the country, irrigation is desirable,
and its benefits should be secured, as far as possible,
by suitable surveys and legal regulations. Most of
the valleys are watered by streams sufficiently large
to be rendered very useful. It would, therefore, seem
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
wise to lay off the land in conformity to the course
of the hills and streams which bound and drain the
valleys.</p>

<p>"A system of drainage, which would also secure
irrigation, is absolutely necessary to give value to the
great plain of the Sacramento and San Joaquin.
This valley is so extensive and level that, if the rivers
passing through it were never to overflow their banks,
the rain which falls in winter would render the greater
portion of it unfit for cultivation. The foundation of
such a system can only be established in the survey
and sale of the land.</p>

<p>"<i>This can be done by laying out canals and drains,
at suitable distances, and in proper directions, and
by leaving wide margins to the rivers, that they may
have plenty of room to increase their channels
when their waters shall be confined within them by
embankments.</i></p>

<p>"It would be well also to regulate the price of
these lands, so as to meet, in some degree, the expense
of draining them.</p>

<p>"This system would, when agriculture shall become
a pursuit in California, make this valley one of the
most beautiful and productive portions of the Union."</p>

<p>With regard to the present state of the commerce
and of the commercial resources of California, it is
observed, that her resources are confined almost
entirely to the metallic wealth of the country, and that
such a state of things would seem unfavorable to an
extensive commercial intercourse. Undoubtedly, this
metallic wealth of itself, could not long maintain an
extensive commerce with the various nations of the
earth. But when the <i>mineral</i> wealth begins to be
developed, as it soon will, there will be no lack of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
return freights for vessels arriving with supplies.
The quicksilver mines already yield an enormous
profit, and will soon be extensively worked. Respecting
the present state of the commerce of the country,
extent of her resources, and facilities of communication
with the Atlantic States of the Union, and other
countries, Mr. King's Report furnishes the following
account&mdash;</p>

<p>"Gold is the product of the country, and is immediately
available, in an uncoined state, for all the
purposes of exchange. It is not there, as in other
countries, where the productions of the earth and of
art are sent to markets&mdash;foreign or domestic&mdash;to be
exchanged for the precious metals, or other articles
of value. There, gold not only supplies the medium
of domestic trade, but of foreign commerce.</p>

<p>"At first view, this state of things would seem to
be unfavorable to an extensive intercourse with other
parts of the world, because of the want of return
freights of <i>home production</i> for the vast number of
vessels which will arrive with supplies.</p>

<p>"These vessels, however, making no calculations
on return cargoes, will estimate the entire profits of
the voyage on their outward freights, and become, on
their arrival, willing carriers for a comparatively small
consideration.</p>

<p>"This tendency in the course of trade, it would
seem, must make San Francisco a warehouse for the
supply, to a certain extent, of all the ports of the
Pacific, American, Asiatic, and the Islands.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">LIFE AT THE &quot;DIGGINGS,&quot;&mdash;SUPPER TIME.</p>
</div>

<p>"Almost every article now exported by them finds
a ready market in California, and the establishment
of a mint will bring there also the silver bullion,
amounting to more than ten millions per annum, from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
the west coast of Mexico, and, perhaps, ultimately
from Chili and Peru, to be assayed and coined.</p>

<p>"Vessels bound round Cape Horn, with cargoes for
markets on the American coast of the Pacific, can, by
taking advantage of the south-east trade winds, and
'standing broad-off the Cape,' make the voyage to
San Francisco in as short a time as they can to
Valparaiso, or any port south of California. Vessels
have sailed from our Atlantic ports to San Francisco
in less than one hundred days, and they have been,
in more than one instance, over one hundred and
twenty days in going from Panama to San Francisco.</p>

<p>"This astonishing difference in time and distance
was caused by the course of the winds, and the gulf-stream
of the Pacific, mentioned in my remarks on the
climate of California.</p>

<p>"The vessels from our Atlantic ports took advantage
of the winds by steering <i>from the Cape</i> as far
into the Pacific as to be enabled to take a course west
of the gulf-stream in sailing northward, thus availing
themselves first of the south-east, then of the north-east
'trades,' and avoiding opposing currents.</p>

<p>"The vessels from Panama were kept back by
calms, adverse winds, and currents. It will be perceived,
therefore, that there can be no inducement for
vessels bound round Cape Horn, with mixed or
assorted cargoes, to stop at Valparaiso, Callao, Guayaquil,
or any port on the west coast, because the exports
of all those places will seek a market at San
Francisco; and their supply of merchandise, as <i>return
freight</i>, will be delivered at less expense than it can
be by vessels direct from Atlantic ports, American or
European. This tendency of trade to concentrate at
San Francisco will be aided by the course of exchange.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span></p>

<p>"Gold dust is worth but $17 per ounce in Chili. It
is worth $18 at the United States mint. If, therefore,
a merchant of Valparaiso has ten thousand
ounces in San Francisco, received in payment for
lumber, barley, flour, or other produce, and desires an
invoice of goods from the United States or Europe,
he will gain $10,000 at the outset by sending his
gold to New York, besides saving something on the
freight and insurance, and at least one month's
interest.</p>

<p>"The countries on the west coast of America have
no exports which find a market in China, or other
parts of Asia. San Francisco will, therefore, become
not only the mart of these exports, but also of the
products and manufactures of India, required in exchange
for them, which must be paid for, principally,
in gold coin or gold dust. Neither gold coin nor gold
dust will answer as a remittance to China. Gold, in
China, is not currency in any shape, nor is it received
in payment of import duties, or taxes on land, or on
the industry of the people.</p>

<p>"The value of pure gold in China is not far from
$14 the ounce. Hence, the importer of manufactures
and products of India into San Francisco will remit
the gold coin or dust direct to New York, for investment
in sterling bills on London. These bills will be
sent to London, and placed to the credit of the firm
in China from whom the merchandise has been
received, and who, on learning of the remittance
having gone forward to their agents, will draw a <i>six
months' sight bill</i> for the amount, which will sell in
China at the rate of four shillings and <i>two</i> pence or
<i>three</i> pence per dollar.</p>

<p>"I have a statement before me from one of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
most eminent merchants and bankers of New York,
who was for many years engaged extensively in the
India trade, which shows that the profit or gain on
ten thousand ounces of gold, thus remitted, would
be</p>

<p>"It will thus be perceived that nature has so
arranged the winds and currents of the Pacific, and
disposed of her vast treasures in the hills and mountains
of California, as to give to the harbor of San
Francisco the control of the commerce of that ocean,
as far as it may be connected with the west coast of
America.</p>

<p>"Important as the commerce of the Pacific undoubtedly
is, and will be, to California, it cannot now,
nor will it ever compare in magnitude and value to
the domestic trade between her and the older States
of the Union.</p>

<p>"Two years ago, California did not probably contain
more than fifteen thousand people. That portion
of it which has since been so wonderfully peopled by
American citizens was, comparatively, without inhabitants,
without resources, and not supplied with the
common comforts of shelter afforded by a forest
country.</p>

<p>"Notwithstanding the great distances immigrants
have been compelled to travel to reach the territory,
more than one hundred thousand have overcome all
difficulties and spread themselves over its hills and
plains. They have been supplied from distances as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
great as they themselves have passed with not only
the necessaries, but the comforts and many of the
luxuries of life. Houses have been imported from
China, Chili, and the Atlantic States of the Union.
All the materials required in building cities and
towns have been added to the wants of a people
so numerous, destitute, and remote from the sources of
supply.</p>

<p>"These wants will exist as long as immigration continues
to flow into the country, and labor employed in
collecting gold shall be more profitable than its application
to agriculture, the mechanic arts, and the great
variety of pursuits which are fostered and sustained
in other civilized communities.</p>

<p>"This may be shown by mentioning the prices of a
few articles. Last summer and autumn, lumber was
sold in San Francisco at $300 to $400 per thousand
feet. At Stockton and Sacramento City, at $500 to
$600. At these prices, it could be made in the territory,
and many persons were engaged in the business.
I perceive, by recent accounts, that the price had
fallen at San Francisco to $75. At this price, it
<i>cannot</i> be made where labor is from $10 to $15 per
day; and the difficulties attending its manufacture
are much greater than in the Atlantic States. Lumber
can be delivered in our large lumber markets for an
<i>average</i> of the various qualities of $16, and freighted
to San Francisco for $24, making $40 per thousand
feet. This price would cause the manufacture of it in
California to be abandoned. We may add $20 per
thousand, to meet any increase of price in the article
itself, or in the freight, and the result would be the
same.</p>

<p>"It is probable that the demand, for several years
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
to come, will not be less than twenty millions of feet
per annum, which, at $40 per thousand, will be
$800,000.</p>

<p>"When California comes to have a population of
200,000, which she will have before the close of the
present year, she will require nearly half a million
barrels of flour from some quarter, and no country
can supply it so good and cheap as the old States of
the Union. Including freight and insurance, this
may be set down as an item of about $5,000,000. The
article of clothing, allowing $20 to each person, would
be $4,000,000.</p>

<p>"There is no pretension to accuracy in these items,
and they may be estimated too high; but it is quite
as probable they are too low.</p>

<p>"We have no data on which to found a calculation
of what the value of the trade between the States east
of the Rocky Mountains and California will be during
the current year. I will venture the opinion, however,
that it will not fall short of twenty-five millions
of dollars. It may go far beyond that sum. At
present, I can conceive no cause which will retard or
diminish immigration.</p>

<p>"If the movement shall continue five years, our
commerce with that territory may reach one hundred
millions per annum. This is doubtless a startling
sum; but it must be borne in mind that we have to
build cities and towns, supply machinery for mining,
coal for domestic purposes, and steam navigation, and
all the multifarious articles used in providing the comforts
and luxuries of life, for half a million of people,
who will have transferred themselves to a country
which is to produce, comparatively, nothing except
minerals and the precious metals, and whose pursuits
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
will enable them to purchase, at any cost, whatever
may be necessary for their purposes.</p>

<p>"It is difficult to imagine or calculate the effect
which will be produced on all the industrial pursuits
of the people of the Old States of the Union, by
this withdrawal from them of half a million of producers,
who, in their new homes and new pursuits,
will <i>give existence</i> to a commerce almost equal in
value to our foreign trade. Let no one, therefore,
suppose he is not interested in the welfare of California.
As well may he believe his interests would
not be influenced by closing our ports and cutting off
intercourse with all the world.</p>

<p>"The distance round Cape Horn is so great that
bread-stuffs and many other articles of food deteriorate,
and many others are so perishable in their nature
that they would decay on the passage. This would
be the case particularly with all kinds of vegetables
and undried fruits. Until some more speedy mode
of communication shall be established by which produce
can be transferred, the farmers and planters of
the old States will not realize the full value of this
new market on the Pacific.</p>

<p>"Many other important interests will be kept
back, especially the consumption of coal. The
American steamers, now on that ocean, those on their
way there, and others shortly to be sent out, will consume
not far from one hundred thousand tons of coal
per annum. The scarcity of wood in California will
bring coal into general use as fuel, as soon as it can
be obtained at reasonable prices. Suppose there may
be, three years hence, forty thousand houses, which
shall consume five tons each per annum. This, with
the steamers, would be a consumption of three hundred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
thousand tons. If delivered at $20 per ton, it would
compete successfully with the coal from Vancouver's
Island and New Holland, and amount to $6,000,000.</p>

<p>"The construction of a railroad across the Isthmus
of Panama would secure the market for those articles
against all competition.</p>

<p>"Some idea may be formed of the demand for them
from the prices paid in San Francisco last autumn.
Coal was sold at $60 to $100 per ton; potatoes $16
per bushel; turnips and onions for 25 to 62½ cents
each; eggs from $10 to $12 per dozen.</p>

<p>"The distance from Chagres to New York has
recently been run in seven days. The same speed
would carry a steamboat from Panama to San Francisco
in ten days. Allow three days to convey freight
across the Isthmus, on a railway, and both passengers
and freight will be conveyed from New York to San
Francisco in twenty days.</p>

<p>"This celerity of movement would secure for
American produce the entire market of California.
Sailing vessels may be successfully employed between
our Atlantic and gulf ports and the terminus of the
railway on this side of the Isthmus; and <i>propellers</i>
from Panama to San Francisco. These latter vessels
will be found peculiarly suited to that trade; they
can use their steam through the calms of the Bay of
Panama, and against head-winds and currents going
north, and their sails with favorable winds and currents
coming south.</p>

<p>"These modes of conveyance, in connection with
the railroad across the Isthmus, would be sufficiently
expeditious and economical to turn the tide of commerce,
between the Atlantic and Pacific States of the
Union, into that channel. The tendency of our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
commerce on the Pacific to promote the employment
of ocean steamers is of much importance as connected
with the defence of our extensive line of coast from
latitude 32° to 49°, the protection of the whale
fishery, and other branches of trade on that ocean.
The establishment of a line of heavy steamers to
China would promote all these objects; increase our
intercourse with that country, and probably be the
means of opening communications with Japan. Money
wisely employed in promoting these objects, it is
believed, would add more to the power and prosperity
of the country than its expenditure on any <i>general
system</i> of fortification at the present prices of labor
and materials. There is one point, however, of such
vast importance that no time should be lost in taking
the necessary steps to render it perfectly impregnable&mdash;that
is, the entrance to the harbor of San Francisco.
On the strength of the works which may be erected
to defend that passage will depend the safety of California
in time of war with a maritime power. Permit
a hostile fleet to cast anchor in the harbor of San
Francisco, and the country would be virtually conquered.</p>

<p>"The coast has not been surveyed, nor has its outline
been correctly ascertained. There are many
rocks above and below the water-line, and small
islands not mentioned or indicated on any chart, which
render navigation near the land, especially at night,
extremely dangerous.</p>

<p>"An accurate survey of the coast, to commence at
the most important points, the construction of lighthouses,
and the placing of buoys in proper positions,
are objects of much importance, and, it is not doubted,
will attract the early attention of Government."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span></p>

<p>We come now to that which has built up so rapidly
this empire of the Pacific&mdash;the metallic and mineral
wealth of California. As to the extent of the region,
and indications of the existence of the gold, together
with the attendant geological formations, the statements
of Mr. King's report will not be, nor have not
been, gainsayed; but as to the origin of the gold,
whether in combination with quartz, or mixed with
the sands of the ravines and streams, various opinions
have been expressed by those who have spent considerable
time in working and observing the different
formations. That due weight may be given to both
of the principal theories, we extract the observation
and opinion of a person who favors the idea of the
gold having been scattered over the country, by a
tremendous volcanic eruption.</p>

<p>"The gold found in every placer in California
bears the most indubitable marks of having, at some
time, been in a molten state. In many parts it is
closely intermixed with quartz, into which it has evidently
been injected while in a state of fusion; and I
have myself seen many pieces of gold completely
coated with a black cement that resembled the lava
of a volcano. The variety of form, which the placer
gold of California has assumed, is in itself sufficient
evidence of the fact, that it has been thrown over the
surface while in a melted state. The earliest comparisons
of the California gold were to pieces of molten
lead dropped into water. The whole territory of the
gold region bears the plainest and most distinct marks
of being volcanic. The soil is of a red, brick color, in
many places entirely barren, and covered with a flinty
rock, or pebble, entirely parched in the summer, and
during the rainy season becoming a perfect mire. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
formation of the hills, the succession of gorges, the
entire absence of fertility in many portions, distinctly
exhibit the result of a great up-heaving during past
times. But there is one phenomenon in the mining
region which defies all geological research founded
upon any other premises than volcanic formation.
Throughout the whole territory, so generally that it
has become an indication of the presence of gold, a
white slate rock is found, and is the principal kind of
rock in the mining region. This rock, instead of
lying as slate rock does in other portions of the earth,
in horizontal strata, is perpendicular, or nearly so;
seeming to have been torn up from its very bed and
left in this position. On the banks of the Middle
Fork are several excavations, which can only be accounted
for upon the supposition, that they were at
some time volcanic craters. There is one of these on
the mountain side, about five miles below the "Big
Bar;" from which, running down to the base of the
mountains, is a wide gorge entirely destitute of verdure,
while the earth around it is covered with shrubbery.
This, I am fully convinced, was the bed of the
lava stream that was thrown up from the crater; and
in searching for gold at the very foot of it, I found
several pieces entirely covered with the black cement
or lava, of which I have previously spoken. From
all these evidences, I am fully satisfied that at some
early date in the world's history, by some tremendous
volcanic eruption, or by a succession of them, gold,
which was existing in the form of ore, mixed with
quartz rock, was fused and separated from its surrounding
substances, and scattered through every
plain, hill, and valley, over an immense territory. By
its own gravity, and the continual washing of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
rains, it sank into the earth until it reached a rock,
or hard, impenetrable clay. It still continued washing
and sliding down the hill-side, until it reached the
rivers or ravines, and in the former was washed along
with its current until it settled in some secure place
in their beds, or was deposited upon their banks; and
in the latter rested among the crevices of rocks."<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>The following from Mr. King's report, presents the
opposite theory, with its evidence in full. The two
accounts are at variance both in regard to fact and
theory. But that of Mr. King, who enjoyed every
facility of obtaining information from observation, and
from the statements of intelligent miners, is considered
most reliable, in respect to matters of fact, and, therefore,
of more dependence in forming a theory. He
says&mdash;</p>

<p>"The principal formation, or substratum, in these
hills, is talcose slate; the superstratum, sometimes
penetrating to a great depth, is quartz. This, however,
does not cover the entire face of the country,
but extends in large bodies in various directions&mdash;is
found in masses and small fragments on the surface,
and seen along the ravines and in the mountains,
overhanging the rivers, and in the hill-sides in its
original beds. It crops out in the valleys and on the
tops of the hills, and forms a striking feature of the
entire country over which it extends. From innumerable
evidences and indications, it has come to be the
universally admitted opinion, among the miners and
intelligent men who have examined this region, that
the <i>gold, whether in detached particles and pieces, or
in veins, was created in combination with the quartz</i>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
Gold is not found on the surface of the country
presenting the appearance of having been thrown up
and scattered in all directions by volcanic action. It
is only found in particular localities, and attended by
peculiar circumstances and indications. It is found
in the bars and shoals of the rivers; in ravines, and
in what are called the 'dry diggings.'</p>

<p>"The rivers, in forming their channels, or breaking
their way through the hills, have come in contact with
the quartz containing the gold veins, and by constant
attrition cut the gold into fine flakes and dust, and it
is found among the sand and gravel of their beds at
those places where the swiftness of the current reduces
it, in the dry season, to the narrowest possible
limits, and where a wide margin is, consequently,
left on each side, over which the water rushes, during
the wet season, with great force.</p>

<p>"As the velocity of some streams is greater than
that of others, so is the gold found in fine or coarse
particles, apparently corresponding to the degree of
attrition to which it has been exposed. The water
from the hills and upper valleys, in finding its way to
the river, has cut deep ravines, and, wherever it has
come in contact with the quartz, has dissolved or
crumbled it in pieces.</p>

<p>"In the dry season, these channels are mostly without
water, and gold is found in the beds and margins
of many of them in large quantities, but in a much
coarser state than in the rivers; owing, undoubtedly,
to the moderate flow and temporary continuance of
the current, which has reduced it to smooth shapes,
not unlike pebbles, but has not had sufficient force to
cut it into flakes or dust.</p>

<p>"The dry diggings are places where quartz containing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
gold has cropped out, and been disintegrated,
crumbled to fragments, pebbles, and dust, by the
action of water and the atmosphere. The gold has
been left as it was made, in all imaginable shapes;
in pieces of all sizes, from one grain to several pounds
in weight. The evidences that it was created in
combination with quartz are too numerous and striking
to admit of doubt or cavil. <i>They are found in combination
in large quantities.</i></p>

<p>"A very large proportion of the pieces of gold
found in these situations have more or less quartz adhering
to them. In many specimens, they are so combined
they cannot be separated without reducing the
whole mass to powder, and subjecting it to the action
of quicksilver.</p>

<p>"This gold, not having been exposed to the attrition
of a strong current of water, retains, in a great
degree, its original conformation.</p>

<p>"These diggings, in some places, spread over valleys
of considerable extent, which have the appearance
of an alluvion, formed by washings from the adjoining
hills, of decomposed quartz and slate earth,
and vegetable matter.</p>

<p>"In addition to these facts, it is, beyond doubt,
true that several vein-mines have been discovered in
the quartz, from which numerous specimens have been
taken, showing the minute connection between the
gold and the rock, and indicating a value hitherto
unknown in gold-mining.</p>

<p>"These veins do not present the appearance of
places where gold may have been lodged by some
violent eruption. It is combined with the quartz, in
all imaginable forms and degrees of richness.</p>

<p>"The rivers present very striking, and, it would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
seem, conclusive evidence respecting the quantity of
gold remaining undiscovered in the quartz veins. It
is not probable that the gold in the dry diggings, and
that in the rivers&mdash;the former in lumps, the latter in
dust&mdash;was created by different processes. That which
is found in the rivers has undoubtedly been cut or
worn from the veins in the rock, with which their
currents have come in contact. All of them appear
to be equally rich. This is shown by the fact that a
laboring man may collect nearly as much in one river
as he can in another. They intersect and cut through
the gold region, running from east to west at irregular
distances of fifteen to twenty, and perhaps some
of them thirty, miles apart.</p>

<p>"Hence it appears that the gold veins are equally
rich in all parts of that most remarkable section of
country. Were it wanting, there are further proofs
of this in the ravines and dry diggings, which uniformly
confirm what nature so plainly shows in the
rivers."</p>

<p>It is an interesting inquiry&mdash;what was the amount
of the golden treasure collected during the years 1848
and '49? The satisfaction of this inquiry will enable
us to form some faint conception of the value of the
gold region, and the dependence which may be placed
upon its yield for a commercial return. Premising
that the gold was first discovered in May, 1848, and
that intelligence of it was not received in the United
States till late in the following autumn, Mr. King, in
his report, proceeds in making an estimate of the
quantity accumulated till the close of 1849:</p>

<p>"No immigration into the mines could, therefore,
have taken place from the old States in that year.
The number of miners was, consequently, limited to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
the population of the territory, some five hundred men
from Oregon&mdash;Mexicans, and other foreigners, who
happened to be in the country, or came into it during
the summer and autumn&mdash;and the Indians, who were
employed by or sold their gold to the whites.</p>

<p>"It is supposed there were not far from five thousand
men employed in collecting gold during that season.
If we suppose they obtained an average of one
thousand dollars each&mdash;which is regarded by well
informed persons as a low estimate&mdash;the aggregate
amount will be $5,000,000.</p>

<p>"Information of this discovery spread in all directions
during the following winter; and, on the commencement
of the dry season in 1849, people came
into the territory from all quarters&mdash;from Chili, Peru,
and other States on the Pacific coast of South America;
from the west coast of Mexico, the Sandwich
Islands, China, and New Holland.</p>

<p>"The immigration from the United States came in
last, if we except those who crossed the Isthmus of
Panama, and went up the coast in steamers, and a
few who sailed early on the voyage round Cape Horn.</p>

<p>"The American immigration did not come in by
sea, in much force, until July and August, and that
overland did not begin to arrive until the last of August
and first of September. The Chilenos and Mexicans
were early in the country. In the month of July,
it was supposed there were fifteen thousand foreigners
in the mines. At a place called Sonoranian Camp, it
was believed there were at least ten thousand Mexicans.
They had quite a city of tents, booths, and
log-cabins; hotels, restaurants, stores, and shops of
all descriptions, furnished whatever money could procure.
Ice was brought from the Sierra, and ice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
creams added to numerous other luxuries. An inclosure
made of the trunks and branches of trees,
and lined with cotton cloth, served as a sort of amphitheatre
for bull-fights. Other amusements, characteristic
of the Mexicans, were to be seen in all directions.</p>

<p>"The foreigners resorted principally to the southern
mines, which gave them a great superiority in numerical
force over the Americans, and enabled them to
take possession of some of the richest in that part of
the country. In the early part of the season, the
Americans were mostly employed on the forks of the
American, and on Bear, Uba, and Feather Rivers.
As their numbers increased, they spread themselves
over the southern mines, and collisions were threatened
between them and the foreigners. The latter,
however, for some cause, either fear, or having satisfied
their cupidity, or both, began to leave the mines
late in August, and by the end of September many
of them were out of the country.</p>

<p>"It is not probable that, during the first part of
the season, there were more than five or six thousand
Americans in the mines. This would swell the whole
number, including foreigners, to about twenty thousand
the beginning of September. This period embraced
about half the season, during which gold may
be successfully collected in the rivers.</p>

<p>"Very particular and extensive inquiries respecting
the daily earnings and acquisitions of the miners
lead to the opinion that they averaged an ounce per
day. This is believed by many to be a low estimate;
but, from the best information I was able to procure,
I am of opinion it approaches very near actual results.
The half of the season, up to the 1st of September,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
would give sixty-five working days, and to
each laborer, at $16 per ounce, $1,040. If, therefore
we assume $1,000 as the average collected by
each laborer, we shall probably not go beyond the mark.</p>

<p>"This would give an aggregate of $20,000,000 for
the first half of the season&mdash;$15,000,000 of which
was probably collected by foreigners. During the
last half of the season, the number of foreigners was
very much diminished, and, perhaps, did not exceed
five thousand. At this time, the American immigration
had come in by land and sea, and the number of
our fellow-citizens in the mines had, as was estimated,
increased to between forty and fifty thousand. They
were most of them inexperienced in mining, and it is
probable the results of their labors were not so great
as has been estimated for the first part of the season,
and experienced miners. Assuming that the average
of half an ounce per day ought to be considered as
reasonable, it would give an aggregate of about
$20,000,000. If from this we deduct one-fourth on
account of the early commencement of the wet season,
we have an estimate of $15,000,000; at least
five of which was collected by foreigners, who possessed
many advantages from their experience in
mining and knowledge of the country.</p>

<p>"These estimates give, as the result of the operations
in the mines for 1848 and 1849, the round sum
of $40,000,000; one-half of which was probably collected
and carried out of the country by foreigners.</p>

<p>"From the best information I could obtain, I am led
to believe that at least $20,000,000 of the $40,000,000
were taken from the rivers, and that their richness
has not been sensibly diminished, except in a few
locations, which had early attracted large bodies of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
miners. This amount has principally been taken
from the northern rivers, or those which empty into
the Sacramento; the southern rivers, or those which
flow into the San Joaquin, having been, comparatively,
but little resorted to until near the close of the
last season. These rivers are, however, believed by
those who have visited them, to be richer in the precious
metal than those in the northern part of the
gold region."</p>

<p>Adopting the hypothesis that the gold found in
these streams had been cut or worn away from
the veins in the quartz through which they have
forced their way, and considering the fact that they
are all equally productive, we may conjecture what a
vast amount of treasure remains undisturbed in the
veins which run through the masses of rock over a
space of forty or fifty miles wide, and near five hundred
miles long. Such an estimate would almost
defy our belief; yet, if the hypothesis is true, there
is no reason to doubt that the value of the gold which
that region will yield, is almost beyond calculation.</p>

<p>The quicksilver mines of California are believed to
be numerous, extensive, and very valuable. The
largest and most profitable one yet opened is situated
near San José, and belongs to, or is claimed by, Mr.
Forbes, of Tepic, in Mexico. The cinnabar ore, which
produces the quicksilver, is easily procured, and
machinery has been put in operation, which enables
the proprietor to make an extensive profit. The value
of the quicksilver mines, by being so near the gold
region, is considerably increased; quicksilver being
almost indispensable in gold mining.</p>

<p>Extensive beds of silver, iron, and copper ores are
believed to exist in the territory, but their existence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
and value is not accurately ascertained, the allurements
held out by the continued success of the gold-miners
and the continued discovery of new and profitable
<i>placers</i> being too strong to permit any search for
the baser, but more useful metals. Respecting the
propriety of the establishment of a mint in California,
Mr. King makes the following observations&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have already alluded to the propriety of establishing
a mint in California. This is important in
many respects. At this time, there is not coin in the
country to supply a currency. Much difficulty is
experienced in procuring enough to pay the duties on
imported goods. The common circulating medium is,
therefore, gold dust, which is sold at $15 50 to $16
per ounce. In the mines, it is frequently sold much
lower. The miners, the laboring men, are the
sufferers from this state of things.</p>

<p>"Those who purchase and ship gold to the Atlantic
States make large profits: <i>but those who dig lose what
others make</i>.</p>

<p>"I have estimated that there will be $50,000,000
collected during the current year. At $16 per ounce,
that sum will weigh 3,125,000 ounces.</p>

<p>"Gold, at the United States mint, is worth $18
per ounce, making a difference in value on that quantity,
between San Francisco and New York, of
$6,250,000, which would be saved to the miners by
the establishment of a mint.</p>

<p>"I have also suggested its importance as a means
of promoting and increasing our trade with the west
coast of Mexico and South America.</p>

<p>"It is not doubted that the construction of a railway
across the Isthmus of Panama, and, perhaps, the
establishment of other lines of communication between
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
the two oceans, will give to the products and manufactures
of the older States of the Union command of
the market of California to the exclusion, in a great
degree, of those of the west coast.</p>

<p>"A mint will, therefore, become of the utmost
importance, to give such marketable value to silver
bullion as to enable the merchants of those countries
to keep up and increase the intercourse with our principal
ports on the Pacific.</p>

<p>"The silver bullion shipped to Europe from the
west coast of Mexico amounts to more than ten
millions of dollars per annum. From the countries
on the west coast of South America, probably an
equal quantity. That from Mexico goes to pay for
European importations into her ports on the Atlantic
side.</p>

<p>"A market at San Francisco for this bullion will
be the means of substituting American and Chinese
fabrics for those of European manufacture in all those
countries. This will greatly increase the trade between
China and California."</p>

<p>A bill for the establishment of a mint at San
Francisco was introduced into Congress, during the
present session, (1849-50) and passed both houses;
thus securing to California the advantages mentioned
in the above extract, by Mr. King.</p>

<p>We have thus given a complete description of
California, in respect to population, climate, soil,
productions, commercial resources, and metallic and
mineral wealth, as accurate and comprehensive as the
most authentic sources could furnish, or as could be
ascertained at the present time. Although the territory
already contains a large population and has produced
a great amount of treasure in the short duration
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
of its existence; although it is already a large
State, which has <i>sprung</i> into existence, as it may be
termed, there is every evidence that this is but the
"beginning of the end." "The greatest is behind."
To what such commercial facilities, mineral and metallic
resources, and an active and progressive population
will conduct California, it is easy to imagine. They
will build up a State, which, although the member of
a confederacy, will be powerful enough to maintain
itself, independent of the aid to be derived from the
Union. Its ports will be the resort of the vessels of
all nations, and its valleys and hill-sides will become
the homes of an agricultural population, reaping the
rich reward of their toil. Canals and railroads, the
children of enterprise, will soon intersect the territory,
transport the riches of one section to another, and
increase the social communication of the inhabitants.
Such a State will add greatly to the power of the
confederated republic, and form an additional stimulus
to the rapid filling up of the vast territory situated
between California and her sister States.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<p class="center p2">
THE DIFFERENT ROUTES TO CALIFORNIA, AND THEIR
RESPECTIVE CHARACTERS.
</p>

<p class="p2">The various routes taken by the emigrants to California
have afforded almost as much matter for discussion
as the territory itself. The shortest and most
travelled route is that by way of the Isthmus of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
Panama; and of this we shall first give a description,
with recommendations to travellers, and the experience
of some who have taken that route to the "land
of promise."</p>

<p>Both steam and sailing vessels are constantly engaged
in carrying freight and passengers from the
principal ports of the Atlantic States to Chagres, the
principal port on the eastern coast of the Isthmus.
Tickets which will carry passengers to Chagres, and,
after crossing the Isthmus, from Panama to San Francisco,
can be purchased in New York, from whence to
Chagres, the passage generally occupies about eight
days, and has been accomplished in seven. The
harbor of Chagres is a small but good one, for vessels
of less than two hundred tons burden. It is protected
by hills on all sides and towards the ocean, by a beetling
cliff, jutting out into the sea, on the summit of
which is the ancient and somewhat dilapidated castle
of San Lorenzo. At the base of this cliff is the channel
which forms an entrance to the town. Ignorance
of this fact caused the wreck of several of the vessels
which went from the United States to Chagres soon
after the receipt of the news of the gold discovery.
The following is a description of Chagres and its
inhabitants in the early part of 1849. It has since
improved considerably, on account of the travel across
the Isthmus.</p>

<p>"The first thing which struck our wondering gaze
on entering Chagres, was its bee-hive appearance. It
is a strange, fantastic, and oddish-looking town, situated
in a deep, dark hollow or cove. It consists of
some forty or fifty huts, with pointed palm-thatched
roofs, and reed walls. Nor were the innumerable
buzzards which were flying about or resting on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
houses, together with the energetic gesticulation of the
natives when in conversation, as we drew near, at all
calculated to lessen the picturesque effect of a first
view. The surrounding country was any thing but
devoid of interest and beauty. All had a strange,
equatorial look; while the green hills around, clothed
with rich tropical verdure, and the graceful and
shadowy palm and cocoanut, with other strange fantastic
trees, together with the ruins of the large old
Spanish castle, on the heights above the town, gave
to the scenery a very beautiful and picturesque aspect.</p>

<p>"Most of us were soon ashore and rambling through
the town. We landed at the beach, on some logs,
which, during the rainy season, are necessary to preserve
the pedestrian from a quagmire, in the midst of
dense foliage that was here luxuriant to the water's
edge, surrounded by about thirty canoes and some
forty or fifty huge black fellows, mostly in the garb in
which nature arrayed them. We passed on beneath
a burning sun, which in the shade brought the thermometer
to 90° of Fahrenheit. A majority of the
natives are black, but some are of a deep copper or
mulatto color. The thick lips and woolly head of the
African; the high cheek-bones, straight hair, and
dogged look of the Indian; and the more chisled features
and finely expressive eyes of the Spaniard, are
all here, though often so blended, that it is difficult to
say to which race they chiefly owe their origin. In
truth they are a mongrel race, but generally have the
most magnificent, large, dark, expressive eyes I have
ever seen. These, when in conversation, which is
almost continual, they use to some purpose, while the
incessant rapid clatter of their tongues, and their
violent gesticulations and grimaces, are often quite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
ludicrous. The females, some of whom have rather
pretty faces, and particularly fine eyes, were dressed
out in the most tawdry finery, with divers furbelows,
flounces, and ruffles, encircling the shoulders, where
the dress begins, and terminating somewhere about
or below the knee. Some of the younger ones were
entirely <i>model artiste</i>, at least so far as their clothing
was concerned, but the forms of most were rather
indifferent. Many were sitting or lounging about the
doors or in the cabins, eating tamarinds, oranges, and
other fruit, surrounded by hairless dogs, pigs, naked
children, turkey-buzzards, and some other <i>little</i> live
stock, forming altogether quite a congruous and homogeneous
mixture.</p>

<p>"In a Country like this, where the temperature is
so nearly alike throughout the year, there is a natural
tendency to indolence and sloth, and it is remarkable
what an influence the climate exerts on the character
of the people. Here nature with a bounteous hand
spontaneously fructifies the earth, and the natives,
with few wants to supply, pluck the fruit and are
satisfied; and with few necessities for enterprise and
industry, such is their love of indolence, that all the
charms of existence appear to consist in dreaming
away life in quiet and repose. Basking beneath a
tropical sun, or listlessly reclining on nature's downy
couch, days&mdash;years&mdash;are passed in drowsy languor
and supine sloth.</p>

<p>"But the influx of men from rougher climes and
bleaker regions will probably exercise a salutary influence,
by showing them the advantages of industry
and patient toil. Already they begin to perceive
this, to some extent, and though such dear lovers of
money, that in closing a bargain they will jabber their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
<i>patois</i>, or bad Spanish, with uncouth gesticulations, for
half a day, the majority of them are unwilling to make
any extra bodily effort to procure it; but when persuaded
by liberal offers to undertake a task, it is
astonishing with what dogged perseverance they will
often pursue it, what weights they can support, and
what toil they can endure."<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>It is recommended that passengers from the States
should remain as short a time in Chagres as possible.
The exhalations from its malarious atmosphere are
extremely prejudicial to the health of the new-comer.</p>

<p>From Chagres, the travellers proceed in canoes up
the Chagres river, to Gorgona, a distance of about
fifty miles, or eight miles further, to Cruces. The
canoes are mostly owned by the natives, and the
greatest care is necessary to get them to keep their
agreement. The usual plan by which their services are
secured, is this: A bargain is made with the owner of the
canoe, stipulating for the necessary captain and poles-men,
and then some of the party going up the river in
the canoe, take possession of it, and maintain it, while
one goes before the alcalde, and pays the whole amount
agreed upon, taking a receipt in Spanish. This precaution
is rendered necessary; the proprietor of the
canoe returning the money to those who engaged it,
on finding he can obtain a greater price from others.
At the present time, vessels, steam and sailing, are
being constructed at Chagres, for the passage up the
river, the increase of the Isthmus travel rendering it
both necessary and profitable.</p>

<p>The beauty of the country through which the
Chagres river flows has been the theme of frequent
praise. Its banks are filled with all the luxuriant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
verdure which tropical climes produce. The tamarind,
the date, the pomegranate, the plantain, the
banana, the cocoanut, the lime, the citron, and the
pine apple, are abundant. Flowers of every hue send
forth their fragrance upon the air, rendering its sweetness
delightful to the senses. Orange groves are
numerous, and the fruit is as plentiful as the apple of
the Southern States of the Union. Mountains, hills,
and valleys diversify the prospect, while the ear is
filled with the melodious notes of thousands of birds,
native of the tropics, their music contrasting with the
discordant noise of the parrots, mackaws, and chattering
monkeys. Such a scene is worth the travel to
the Isthmus, and the toils sometimes endured in crossing
it.</p>

<p>Several small towns and ranches are scattered
along the banks of the river. The first is Gatun, ten
or twelve miles above Chagres. About ten miles
further is Dos Hermano; further on, Pûro Blanco,
and Palenquillá last, about two-thirds of the way to
Gorgona. These are stopping places for the canoes,
where refreshments and supplies can be procured.</p>

<p>At night, parties that land are compelled to build
fires to keep off the wild beasts and venomous serpents,
which abound in the neighborhood of the river,
and to disperse the myriads of insects with which the
air teems. Alligators of a large size, are to be seen
lying on the banks in the day time, basking in the
sun. Above Palenquillá are some powerful currents,
which it requires considerable toil to move against.
The river is in some places a half a mile wide, and
in others, not more than thirty yards. The boatmen
are exceedingly indolent, and require constant driving
and coaxing to keep them moving; but sometimes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
when they are prevailed upon to go to work, they will
exhibit an endurance and perseverance almost astonishing.
They have been frequently known to work
at the poles, pushing the boat along, for twenty-four
hours, without rest. The difficulty of ascending the
Chagres river, may be appreciated, when it is stated,
that although Gorgona is only fifty miles from the
town of Chagres, it frequently occupies as high as
forty hours for the canoes to reach that place. Stoppages
are, of course, numerous, both on account of
the tiring of the boatmen and for refreshment.</p>

<p>"Gorgona is located upon a bend of the river,
from which a fine view of the river and valley is obtained.
The valley is here about five miles wide, the
mountains rising from it in successive ranges, and
with increasing elevations. It is an admirable location
for a town, and must become one of considerable
importance&mdash;especially should it be on the route of
the proposed railroad across the Isthmus. It has a
far better appearance than Chagres; the streets are
laid out with some pretensions to regularity. It is
the head of canoe navigation, and steamboats of light
draft can approach it. The dwellings or huts are of a
better class than those at Chagres; they have an unfinished
Catholic church that looks rude and ragged,
but nevertheless, it is a church. The carrying trade
is now almost the only business pursued by its inhabitants;
what they did before the gold of California
began to invite a swarm of adventurers across the
Isthmus, to the town is more than can be divined.
Theirs must have been as near a pastoral or primitive
life, as any that can be seen in our day. The soil is
teeming with the evidences of its richness&mdash;inviting
the hand of man to its cultivation, by showing what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
it is capable of doing without it&mdash;but it is undisturbed,
save in a few stinted spots of less size than
our ordinary kitchen gardens. All else is left to
spontaneous production. They have herds of cattle;
these, with game, flesh, fish, and fowl, easily procured,
must have been their principal sustenance. But
it is with them as with the rest of the world, wants
increase with the facilities for gratifying them. They
are rapidly changing their habits since they have an
opportunity to earn money and luxuries, that they
have been strangers to, are brought within their
means and their reach.</p>

<p>During the <i>dry season</i>, which lasts from December
till June, the road from Gorgona to Panama is generally
preferred; at other times, the canoes proceed
up the river about eight miles, to the town of Cruces,
and take the road leading from that place to Panama.
Each of these routes shall receive our consideration,
and their respective advantages and disadvantages be
set forth. It is advisable, that travellers should rest
as short a time as possible at Gorgona, as accommodations
are of very poor character. Mules and a small
species of mustang are easily obtained, but the mule
is far preferable. Some travellers find it a great
relief to walk a part of the distance, and, with that
intention, parties hire mules or horses in the proportion
of two to every three travellers. The baggage
will have to be placed under the charge of the native
muleteers, but, from their observed habits of filching
wherever they get a chance, it is advisable not to
trust them out of sight. There are several places
upon the route where refreshments can be procured;
but most of the travellers start at daylight from Gorgona,
and push directly through to Panama, in one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
day. This is the best mode of proceeding, if the
fatigue is found to be endurable; for it is above all
things important that in such a climate too great
fatigue should be avoided. The following account of
a journey to Panama by way of the Gorgona road,
and descriptions of the road is from a recently published
narrative:</p>

<p>"We arose from cot and hammock, flea-bitten, and
but little refreshed, though ready to start on what we
deemed our perilous journey across the Isthmus.
Hour after hour elapsed, till the most pleasant part
of the day was gone, and the sun shone with torrid
fervor; but still our mules were not ready, our host
keeping them back, as we afterwards learned, to obtain
a higher rate. Annoyed beyond endurance at the
delay, and the tardy movements of the worthless set
around us, we scoured the town, and at length succeeded
in obtaining four miserable-looking little animals
at eight dollars a-piece. Another was still
wanting, and, by an offer of ten dollars, I at length
succeeded in getting a tolerably good one. Though
so wretched in appearance, we found these animals
capable of great endurance.</p>

<p>"Glad that the vexatious and irritating events of
the morning, which the cupidity and dogged laziness
of these slothful mongrels had produced, were happily
ended, we hastily swallowed a cup of bad coffee, handed
by a damsel nearly <i>nude</i>, and mounting our <i>Rosinantes</i>,
we started at a brisk canter, beneath a broiling sun,
while our <i>guido</i>, all stripped and on foot, trotted off
in advance.</p>

<p>"For the first mile, the way was very pleasant over
a nearly level plain, at the termination of which there
were stronger indications of rougher riding, for we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
soon began to descend a nearly perpendicular precipice,
the only pass, down which was a narrow mule-way,
where, step by step, these animals had worn a
passage, over rocks, loose stones, sand and mud. We
at length reached the bottom of the ravine, and, crossing
a brook, which in some parts was a wide and deep
chasm, we commenced a toilsome ascent on the opposite
side, over a similar pathway, surrounded by
scenery of wild and unknown plants and trees, on the
mountain and glen, through whose dense foliage a
breath could scarcely penetrate. The fervent atmosphere
produced an almost stifling sensation, while the
deathlike silence that reigned throughout, disturbed
only by the audible footfall of our animals, as we
slowly wound around the tortuous ascent, made the
journey peculiarly toilsome and solitary.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_196.jpg" width="393" height="600" alt="SONORIANS DRY-WASHING GOLD." />
<p class="caption">SONORIANS DRY-WASHING GOLD.</p>
</div>

<p>"For the first few miles I followed closely at the
heels of our guide, and would often pause and turn to
examine the apparently almost impassable route I had
traversed, watch the progress of the rest of the party,
and wonder at the security with which their cautiously-stepping
and sagacious animals would gradually overcome
seemingly insurmountable obstacles. These
mustangs and mules, early trained to travel 'in the
wild mountain track,' are capable of great endurance,
and certainly possess much more knowledge than most
of their riders, when exercised upon what they consider
the safest and surest stepping-place, and best mode
of proceeding. I urged mine repeatedly, to make him
choose a path, which to all appearance was preferable
to his own, but to no purpose. He would turn half
round, and in a slow, solemn way, put his nose to the
ground, and looking keenly about the place, would
cautiously put one foot forward, then another, then a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
third and a fourth, when, poised on all drawn under
him, and close together, he would have a better opportunity
for further inspection, which having satisfactorily
accomplished, another equally deliberate and cautious
step would be made as before, down what, to all
appearance, was an impracticable route, and so on,
until the difficulty was overcome. Finding that he
knew so much better than I did, how, where, and
when he ought to travel, I invariably threw the reins
to him, when hazardous passes or other obstacles were
to be surmounted. The result was always fortunate.
One or two of the party, however, were satisfied that
'horses should not have their own way,' and whipped
and spurred theirs to such an extent, to compel compliance
with their better judgment, that the issue was
as I had anticipated. One was thrown over his horse's
head into a mud puddle, and the other, with horse and
all, stuck fast in a quagmire, from which it was not
easy to extricate him. Should these lines ever meet
the eye of those worthy gentlemen, I trust they will
pardon the liberty I have taken in recording here their
feats of muleship. It is true that mine stumbled on
some loose stones once or twice, in descending hills,
and my efforts alone with the reins saved both him
and me from a fall; but for unmistakeable judgment
in traversing these perilous mountain-passes, I must
admit he proved himself the better of the two.</p>

<p>"Thus we trudged on, often over difficult, and sometimes
dangerous ways. Occasionally we would have
to go up or down, as the case might be, for nearly
half a mile at one time, through a chasm or sluice,
probably worn in the mountains by the torrents of
water that descend during the rainy season. These
gully-holes are often ten and fifteen feet deep throughout
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
their entire extent, and the passes are so narrow,
as barely to admit of one horse or mule passing
through at a time; the rider, to avoid a severe contusion,
or probably a broken limb, in turning the sharp
angles, being compelled to place his feet as near the
animal's head as possible, and in this manner he can
ride in perfect safety, though some little management
is requisite to maintain an equilibrium. Before entering
these defiles, the muleteers shout at the top of
their voices, and stop for a short time, continuing the
shouting as they advance, to apprize others at the
opposite extremity of the pass, that the way is already
occupied. This is necessary and important, for if two
on horseback were to meet in one of these narrow
but crooked paths, the scene between the Quaker and
Dandy would have to be re-enacted, for many newspapers
would have to be read, and many segars
smoked, before either could turn out of the way for
his neighbor.</p>

<p>"Continuing on, we passed two or three <i>hackalas</i>,
or huts, by the way, and after several brief but pleasant
stoppages at the various brooks and mountain-rills, we
at length came out on a beautiful undulating meadow,
where picturesque villas and shadowy trees decked the
verdant plain, and soon thereafter the towers of
Panama were in view. The sun was just setting as we
entered the suburbs, and a flood of purple glory rested
on the sky, reflected back by the sparkling waters of
the Pacific, which brought the distant mountains into
bolder relief, and cast a deeper shadow through the
twilight groves. Half an hour's ride over the paved
street, brought us to the city, which we entered at the
'Gorgona gate,' passing through a heavy stone arch
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
way, supporting a cupola, in which hangs the alarm
bell mounted by a cross."<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>Such is the character of the Gorgona road to Panama.
With regard to the Crucis road, we may observe
that it is a common practice, for most of those who
take the Gorgona road in going to Panama, on their
return, to take the Crucis road, no doubt hoping that
the difficulties and toil to be encountered are less than
those they know are to be met with upon the other.
The following account of a return journey by way of
the Crucis road, with the full character of the route,
is given in the journal of a returned adventurer.</p>

<p>"I had passed three days in Panama; and, feeling
desirous of continuing my journey, I had no sooner
concluded this arrangement, than I got my mule saddled,
and my box and carpet-bag packed in the regular
Isthmus fashion. The mule I obtained, like most of
his fellows, was little better than a mere skeleton;
but still it was the best I could procure, and I was
fain to content myself with it. Some of my friends
endeavored to persuade me that it was better to proceed
on foot; but I knew the muddy and stony nature
of the road, and thought it infinitely more comfortable
to ride a slow animal than subject myself to the sufferings
that I must experience from these inconveniences.</p>

<p>"The negro, I had hired, brought to my hotel a
long frame of bamboo, with a sort of basket at the
end, into which he crammed my luggage. This frame
had two straps fastened to the upper part of it,
through one of which he slipped his arm, whilst he
passed the other over his left shoulder, and attached
it under the latter to the frame which was now on
his back. This contrivance not only effectually
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
secures the load in its place, but protects the shoulders
of the bearer from the continual friction they would
otherwise undergo.</p>

<p>"A large party had preceded me; but I felt no
anxiety to overtake it, as there was little or no danger
of my encountering violence on the route. I was
armed with a good revolving pistol, in the event of
any thing of the sort presenting itself; so that, all
things considered, I was just as well pleased to be
left to my own society.</p>

<p>"I proceeded on my route with my sable attendant,
and found the commencement pleasant enough travelling,
the road for some distance being paved with
large and regularly cut stone. This, however, soon
terminated in abundance of sand; the route still continuing
dry, and comparatively easy to what I had
expected to find it. Soon after we had quitted the
paved road, the negro stopped and asked my permission
to take a few things to his family, who lived in a
small hut to our left. Apprehensive that he was
meditating an escape with my luggage, I replied that
I had no objection, provided he would leave his
basket in my care. He accordingly took the frame
off his back, and, separating a small bundle containing
provisions from my baggage, he took his departure.
I took care, however, to keep him in sight and saw
him enter a wretched-looking bamboo-hut at a little
distance from the route. He remained absent a considerable
time; and, having paid him half his wages
in advance, according to the usual custom with these
people, who are exceedingly distrustful, I began to
fear that he was about to desert me, and therefore
called out lustily, until at last I saw him reluctantly
emerge from the hut, and make his way towards me.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
These negroes being constantly in the habit of deserting
travellers on the route, and stealing their baggage
whenever the opportunity presents itself, I was
particularly careful not to lose sight of my attendant.</p>

<p>"A few miles further on, I again found myself on
a stone road, said to have been paved by Cortes to
facilitate the passage of his troops from the Atlantic
to the Pacific coast; and, although I have travelled
rougher and steeper routes in Lower California, I cannot
say that I have ever encountered such a combination
of petty difficulties and annoyances. The road
is, for the greater part, barely wide enough to admit
of one mule passing with its packs, the sides forming
steep embankments, composed chiefly of rich clay,
out, in many places, of large rocks, through which a
passage had evidently been cut with great labor.
But little of the country can be seen on either side,
owing to the height of these embankments; but now
and then the traveller obtains a glimpse of dense
thickets, and occasionally of undulating hills, the
summits of which are covered with a deep perennial
green. The recent rains having poured in torrents
down the steep sides of the road, every cavity and
crevice was filled with water and mud. Owing to the
nature of the soil, and the constant traffic across the
route from the time it was originally cut through,
innumerable stones and flags had sunk considerably
below the level of their original position; whilst a
few had retained their places, as if to serve as stepping-stones
to the traveller over the wet and mud.
It is a task of incessant and wearying exertion, however,
even for those who are mounted on mules, to
avoid floundering into some of these pitfalls and quagmires
at every step they make.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span></p>

<p>"The mules themselves are, as I have already stated,
so worn-out, and broken-down, that it requires the
utmost vigilance and care on the part of their riders
to prevent them dropping, and precipitating them into
the mire. In order to guard as much as possible
against this contingency, whenever ladies travel this
route, they are obliged to discard the side-saddle, and
resort to a less feminine style of equitation. I overtook
a party of about twenty persons on the road, amongst
whom was a married lady on her way to the States;
and I watched her rather curiously, to observe how
she got over the difficulties that beset her. Being
fortified with that article of male attire, the figurative
possession of which is said to denote domestic ascendency,
she thought it incumbent upon her, I suppose,
to display all the courage and nerve that should
properly be encased in it. Several times, when I
fancied that both she and her mule were on the point
of being capsized, she recovered herself with admirable
presence of mind, and seemed to enjoy the
risk exceedingly.</p>

<p>"As to myself, I floundered on as well as I could
with a mule tottering beneath me from sheer exhaustion,
and sinking every minute up to his knees in
mud. It seemed to me that we were making little or
no progress; and I became thoroughly tired and disheartened.
I do not know any temptation, however
powerful, that would again induce me to encounter
the never-ending series of difficulties and annoyances
that laid in wait for me at every step; and I must
candidly own, that even the force of female example,
of which I had so merry a specimen before me, did
not at all shame me into a less impatient endurance
of them.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span></p>

<p>"The negroes whom I met on their way to and
from Panama excited my astonishment, from the
amount of physical exertion which they seemed
capable of undergoing. With their legs and feet bare,
and nothing but a cloth around their loins, they carried
enormous burdens on their backs, stepping from
stone to stone with wonderful strength and dexterity.
These poor creatures must lead the most wretched
and laborious of all the painful modes of existence to
which their race is condemned; and not even long
habit, or their peculiar physical construction, can divest
it of its distressing character in the eyes of a
stranger. They all bear, on their hard and wrinkled
faces, the stamp of overtaxed strength; but they
seemed content with their lot, and will, doubtless,
regret the formation of a better route, as tending to
depreciate the value of their services. Notwithstanding
the toilsome and laborious nature of their occupations,
however, the carriers of Panama are the hardiest
and most muscular race to be seen here; for the
rest of the population, both white and black, are of
comparatively sickly and diminutive appearance.</p>

<p>"Moving somewhat like a ship in a storm, rising
and sinking alternately at stern and bow, surmounting
first one huge stone, then a deep mud hole, then
another stone, and then a small lake, my mule and myself
at last reached Crucis in the evening, the whole
distance traversed not being above twenty miles."<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>The town of Crucis is a place very similar to Gorgona,
but not so large. The houses are built of cane
and plastered with mud. No attention is given to
arrangement, and but a small portion is so constructed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
as to bear any resemblance to a street. The climate
is unhealthy, and travellers from the United States
make as short a stay there as possible. Doubtless,
with the increase of travel, the character of the town
and its accommodations will improve; but the heat
and humidity of the atmosphere, particularly just
after the rainy season, cause a great deal of injury to
the health of people from the United States, and will
prevent any considerable settlement of Anglo-Saxons
in the town.</p>

<p>Panama, the terminus of the varied and difficult
route across the Isthmus, is situated on the shore of
an extensive and beautiful bay. It contains about
eight thousand inhabitants, most of whom are negroes.
Being one of the old Spanish towns, upon the decline
of the Spanish power, the place fell into decay. The
houses are generally of stone or brick, two and three
stories in height, whitewashed or covered with a coat
of plaster, and are invariably surrounded by a balcony
protected from sun and rain by the roofs of the
houses extending over them. The town is regularly
arranged, the strait and narrow streets intersecting
each other at right angles. The substantial character
of the buildings as well as the evidences of neglect
and decay, strike the traveller at the same time. A
wall was built by the Spaniards, around the portion
of the town nearest the bay, but at least one half of
the population reside beyond its limits, and it is in a
dilapidated state. A venerable, decayed, but still
imposing cathedral; a grand <i>plaza</i>, or open common&mdash;a
general characteristic of Spanish built towns;
several churches, partly in ruins; the ruins of the
College of Jesuits, which cover a large extent, and of
two monasteries, of which the walls and bells alone
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
remain; and the frowning walls and towers of the
battery, fronting the bay, are the principal features
of the town of Panama. Since the commencement
of the emigration to California, a number of Americans
have established hotels and eating-houses in the
town, and good accommodations are, therefore, to be
obtained by travellers.</p>

<p>The atmosphere at Panama is particularly injurious
to people from the northern climes, and great care
must be taken by travellers during their stay at that
place. It is best to avoid eating fruit altogether; but,
if indulged in, it should be in very inconsiderable
quantities. Exposure to the mid-day sun is a frequent
cause of sickness among the travellers, and
should be avoided, as well as exposure to the rain.
During the rainy season, the <i>vomito</i> is often prevalent
among the inhabitants of Panama, and is generally a
fatal disease; but there is a great deal less travel
across the Isthmus during that season, on account of
the sickliness of the climate and the difficulties of the
route. A sort of bilious fever and dysentery are the
most common forms of disease among travellers from
the north; but both may be avoided by proper care.</p>

<p>From Panama, steamships of superior size and
accommodation, convey passengers to San Francisco.
Starting from the front of the city, the beautiful bay,
with its semi-circular shores skirted with green foliage
and inclosed with high mountains, and the lofty
islands of Flamingo, Perico, Taboga, and others,
present themselves to the view. At the island of Taboga,
all the vessels that come into the bay obtain
their supplies, and the Pacific Mail Steamship Company
have established their depot for coal, &amp;c., on
its shores. After obtaining all the necessary supplies
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
the steamship moves out of the bay, rounding Point
Mala. The voyage upon the Pacific, with all its
variety of incident and scenery, then commences.
The principal annoyance of travellers is the almost
intolerable heat of the sun and furnaces of the steamship
united. Water-spouts and different species of
whale are frequent sights. North of the Gulf of Tehuantepec,
the steamer nears the land, and the bold
mountain coast of Mexico breaks upon the view, and,
at night, the passengers enjoy a view of the glaring
light produced by the burning volcano of Colima;
though the volcano itself is but imperfectly seen
being at the distance of ninety miles from the vessel.
Soon after this fades from the view, the islands off the
town of San Blas appear, and an immense white rock,
isolated from the sea, serving as a lighthouse to ships
steering for the port. At San Blas, the steamships
remain some time, to obtain supplies of coal, fresh
fruits, and provisions. These indispensables having
been procured, the vessel proceeds upon her voyage.
Cape Corientes next appears, and, soon afterwards,
the entrance to the Gulf of California is approached;
and then, Cape San Lucas, the extreme southern
point of California, with its mountains and rocky
shores, is hailed by the traveller as the first portion of
the "promised land" that greets his sight. Passing
along the western coast of the peninsula, the island
and bay of Magdalena appear, with shores three or
four thousand feet above the sea. Next, the towering
ridges of Cerros Isles are passed, and the bold, rocky
shores of the peninsula are in continual view. The
change of the temperature of the air is generally
keenly felt by those who do not take care to provide
against it. Within a few days after leaving Panama,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
the thermometer falls from 95° to 55°, and such a
change must have an injurious effect, if additional
clothing is not put on to meet it.</p>

<p>The first portion of Upper California, or, the
"Golden Land," which presents itself to the voyagers,
is the Ceronados, two high, round-topped rocks
off the port of San Diego. Then the beautiful, semi-circular
harbor is entered, and if wanting, supplies
are obtained from the town. From the harbor of San
Diego, the vessel proceeds along the coast of California,
and the towering peaks of the coast range of
mountains, engage the attention. The high promontory
of St. Vincent is passed, and then the open
bay of Monterey is entered, and passengers are either
let off the steamer or taken aboard as necessity may
occasion. From Monterey the steamer keeps along
the coast, and mountainous shores alone meet the
view, until the voyagers come in sight of the Farallones,
two large detached rocks at the southern side
of the entrance to the bay of San Francisco. Then
the Golden Gate, as the strait or entrance is called, is
entered by the steamer, and the perpendicular cliffs
and hills upon each shore afford matter for wonder.
The strait is about three miles long, and from one to
two miles broad. As the vessel reaches its terminus,
the great bay of San Francisco opens to the view,
looking like a miniature ocean. Bird Island, Wood
Island, Angel Island, with the beautiful little bay of
Sancelito, successively meet the gaze, and very soon
the steamer is anchored, having reached her destination.
Such is the Isthmus route to the "gold region."
It is the shortest route, or the one which occupies
the least time in traversing, presents great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
variety, and upon the whole, its beauties and pleasures
outnumber the difficulties and annoyances.</p>

<h3>THE OVERLAND ROUTE.</h3>

<p>We now proceed to give the general character and
direction of that which is considered the best land
route to California, and which is the most travelled
by emigrants. The principal advantage possessed by
this route may be stated in a few words. It is the
shortest route to the bay of San Francisco and the
gold region. The Indians upon the route are friendly
and very few acts of hostility have been committed.
The trail is plain and good where there are no physical
obstructions. To these must be added the certainty
of the emigrants reaching their place of destination,
in good season; which will not exist, if new and unexplored
routes are attempted. The greatest calamities
and sufferings have been endured by those who
have either taken an entirely different route, or deviated
from the line which we will describe. Advice
concerning the time of starting, preparations, &amp;c.,
will be interspersed in the description.</p>

<p>The starting point, and the general rendezvous for
emigrants, is the town of Independence, Missouri, situated
about six miles from the Missouri River, on the
south side of it. This town has been, for many years,
the principal outfitting point for the Santa Fe traders,
and contains about two thousand inhabitants. Emigrants
should be at the starting place by the 20th of
April, and start upon their journey as soon thereafter
as the grass will permit. The outfit of companies of
emigrants would be too tedious to mention, and as it
varies considerably, from differences of means and
taste, a description would hardly be accurate. But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
there are certain things which are indispensable to
those who take this route, and these we will mention.
With respect to wagons and teams, the lightest wagon
that can be constructed of sufficient strength to carry
2,500 pounds weight, is the vehicle most desirable.
This can be drawn by three or four yokes of oxen, or
six mules; oxen are usually employed for this purpose.
Pack mules can only be employed by parties of men;
but the journey can be made in great deal less time
with mules than with oxen. The provisions taken by
the companies, consist mainly of flour, bacon, coffee,
and sugar; besides these indispensables, there is rice,
crackers, salt, pepper, and other luxuries of light
weight. As to the quantity necessary, that may be
determined by considering the length of the route
and the average number of miles which the emigrants
travel per day. From Independence to the first settlement
in California, which is near the gold region,
it is about two thousand and fifty miles&mdash;to San Francisco,
2,290 miles. Oxen teams travel about fifteen
miles per day upon an average. At that rate, it would
require one hundred and thirty-one days to reach the
first settlement in California. Allowance should be
made for stoppages by accident. Every man should
be provided with a good rifle, a pair of pistols, with a
quantity of ammunition, and a bowie knife and hatchet,
in his belt. A set of carpenter's tools is also necessary.</p>

<p>Starting from Independence, and travelling a few
miles over a good road, the first prairie opens upon
the view. This is called the Blue Prairie, and presents
a surface undulating and clothed with rich verdure.
In crossing this prairie, violent storms often
overtake the emigrants, and to those who have not
been accustomed to it, the scene during the storm is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
terrifically grand. Fourteen miles travel upon the
prairie brings the emigrants to the "Blue Creek,"
which is fordable, except after a heavy rain. Fording
the creek and crossing the timbered bottom of the
stream, another magnificent prairie is entered, which
is beyond the Missouri line, and within the Indian territory.
Sixteen miles travel over this beautiful plain
brings the emigrant to Indian Creek, the banks of
which usually serve for a place of encampment. The
prairie offers the best pasturage for cattle; but constant
watching is necessary to keep them from straying
away and returning to the settlements. From
Indian Creek, the emigrants proceed across the prairie,
along the Santa Fe trail, for about fifteen miles, and
then leave it, turning off to the right hand. Crossing
several deep ravines, which are very difficult of
passage in rainy weather, the emigrants arrive on the
banks of the Werkarusa Creek. This is another
favorite place of encampment, groves of trees being
on each side of it. From this creek, the route is over
the high-rolling prairie, upon a smooth and hard trail.
The want of water is the only annoyance that is experienced
by the travellers, and a long day's journey
is necessary to bring them to the nearest creek&mdash;a
branch of the Kansas River. The banks of the creek
are steep, and considerable toil is requisite to cross it.</p>

<p>The crossing of the Kansas River is the next difficulty
to be met. There is a regular ferry about five
miles from where the emigrants cross the tributary
creek. At that place the river is never more than
two hundred yards wide, even after heavy rains. The
wagons are placed in boats, owned by the Indians,
and transported to the opposite shore for the sum of
one dollar per load. The oxen and horses are compelled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
to swim across. Following the trail for about
three miles, a place of encampment, on the banks of
Soldier Creek, is reached. The soil in the neighborhood
of the Kansas is luxuriantly productive, and the
most refreshing verdure meets the eye along the
trails from that river to Soldier Creek. The route
is then pursued over a flat plain&mdash;boggy in some
places&mdash;for several miles, till another creek is reached,
the banks of which are steep, and this, as in other
cases, make its crossing a matter of great toil. The
trail then runs over a high, undulating country, presenting
every variety of scenery, as far as Black
Paint Creek, near which are two Kansas Indian villages.
The Kansas are a friendly tribe, and if they
were not, they are not powerful enough to attack large
parties of emigrants. They are somewhat disposed
to pilfer whatever they can conveniently, and require
close watching.</p>

<p>After crossing the creek, the trail is followed
through a fertile valley, across Hurricane Creek, which
is somewhat difficult of passage, and then over an
open and rolling prairie, broken by small branches
and ravines. Many places, convenient for encamping,
are to be found on the route, some of which have
springs of pure cold water. Farther on, the ground
becomes more broken, and Vermilion Creek, a large
and rapid stream, is reached. Its banks are steep,
and its fording very toilsome and difficult. Between
this creek and the Big Blue, there is neither wood
nor water to be obtained, and therefore, it is customary
for the emigrants to fill their casks at this
place. The ground between the two streams, a distance
of ten miles, is more broken than any upon
the former part of the route, and on arriving at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
Big Blue, a steep descent is made to the low, bottom
lands near the river. The usual width of the Big
Blue is about a hundred yards, at which time alone
it is fordable. It becomes much swollen by heavy
rains, and very rapid in its current.</p>

<p>Arising from the bottom of the Big Blue River, the
emigrants are again upon the high and undulating
prairie. Every variety of scenery is presented to the
view, and springs of water, issuing from the cliffy
banks of the small branches and ravines, and shaded
by groves of trees offer many places for rest and refreshment.
Fourteen miles from the Big Blue, one
of its tributaries, exceedingly difficult to cross with
large wagons and teams, is met with. After passing
it, the trail runs over a smooth inclined plane for the
distance of twelve miles, to another encamping place
for emigrants, upon the banks of a small creek.
From that creek there is a gradual ascent for the distance
of about fourteen miles, and then a beautiful
valley, through which flows a small stream, meets the
eye of the wearied emigrants, and offers groves of
oak to serve for places of rest. Then there is another
gradual ascent, through a country which is more
sandy and less fertile than any met with upon the
former part of the route, for more than twenty miles.
The Little Blue is then reached, and the train continues
along up the banks of the stream for the distance
of about fifty miles; the road being dry and
firm, except in a few ravines. The trail then diverges
from the stream to the right, ascending over the
bluffs, into the high table land of the prairie, and
continues to ascend gradually until the bluffs overlooking
the valley of the Platte River, are reached. The
soil along this part of the trail is sandy, and the grass
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
rather scarce; but water can be obtained at several
places.</p>

<p>The Platte River is about one hundred and fifty
yards in breadth where the trail reaches it. The
current is sluggish and turbid, and the water is very
shallow. The trail continues along the banks of the
river, the course of which is nearly from west to east,
and the road is all that could be wished for travelling.
The bluffs which skirt the valley present considerable
variety, and as the route is continued, they become
more elevated and broken. The soil of the valley
becomes less fertile and the vegetation is thin and
short. After traversing the valley of the Platte for
the distance of one hundred and thirty miles, the
trail crosses the river and continues along the northern
bank of the south fork for about twelve miles,
when it diverges from the stream to pass over the
prairie to the north fork. The distance from the
south to the north fork of the Platte, by the emigrant
trail, is about twenty-two miles, without water. The
country between the two streams is high and rolling.
The soil is poor, the grass short, and no trees or
shrubs are visible. The trail descends into the valley
of the north fork of the Platte, through a pass known
as Ash Hollow. There is but one steep or difficult
place for wagons in the pass, and in the valley will be
found a spring of pure cool water. At this place,
there is a sort of post office, where letters are left by
emigrants, with requests that they shall be taken to
the States by those who pass this way.</p>

<p>For several miles from Ash Hollow the trail passes
over a sandy soil, which is very soft, but which afterwards
becomes firmer. The scenery then presents
the aspect of barrenness and desolation. Sand and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
rocks are all that meet the view for many miles. The
landscape then assumes a greener and more refreshing
appearance, and groves of trees relieve the emigrants
from pursuing their way any farther during
the day. Farther on, the well-known landmark, called
the "Chimney Rock," which can be seen at a great
distance, is met by the emigrants. It is composed of
soft rock, and is several hundred feet high. The
scenery in the neighbourhood of the rock is very
remarkable and picturesque. There are a number of
rocky elevations which present the appearance of
vast temples and pyramids, with domes and spires
partially in ruins. Over a sandy soil, the trail is
pursued for about twenty miles, the surrounding
scenery being of the most sublime and singular character.
Near a remarkable rocky conformation, called
"Scott's Bluff," the trail leaves the river, and runs
over a smooth valley in the rear of the bluff. It
there ascends to the top of the dividing ridge, from
which the Rocky Mountains can be seen. Descending
from the ridge, it passes over a barren country, broken
by deep chasms and ravines, for about twelve miles,
when Horse Creek is reached. From that creek, the
trail is followed to the Platte River, where a place for
encampment is found, though the grass is very indifferent.
Continuing for several miles through a
barren country, the trail is followed to "Fort Bernard,"
a small building, rudely constructed of logs,
used as a trading-post. Eight miles farther on, is
Fort Laramie, or Fort John, as it is sometimes called.
This fort has been the principal trading-post of the
American Fur Company. It is situated in the Laramie
River, near its junction with the Platte, and is six
hundred and seventy-two miles from Independence.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
The building is quadrangular, and is constructed of
<i>adobé</i>, or sun-dried bricks. Its walls are surmounted
by watch-towers and its gate is defended by two
brass swivels.</p>

<p>From Fort Laramie, the trail continues on through
a broken country, to the Platte River, a distance of
twenty miles. Crossing a small creek which empties
into the Platte, it proceeds through the dry bed of
one of its branches, over a deep sand for six or eight
miles, and reaches the summit of a high ridge. From
thence it descends into a narrow valley, through
which flows a small stream of pure water. Another
ridge of hills is then ascended, and a wild, desolate,
but picturesque scene is presented to the view. Numerous
lofty mountain peaks, barren rocks, and a vast
prospect of low conical hills are the principal features.
Through a country, the principal features of which
are of this description, the trail is followed, and the
monotony of the journey is only relieved by an occasional
stoppage at a refreshing spring of water. The
trail gradually ascends towards the summit of the
Rocky Mountains, and the country becomes more
broken and sterile, till it reaches Beaver Creek, a
tributary of the Platte. There the grass and water
are good, and the wood is abundant. The country
exhibits every indication of fertility upon the trail leading
from Beaver Creek, and pure and limpid streams
are frequent, until the Platte River is again struck
and followed upon its southern bank, for the distance
of about eighteen miles. The river is then forded,
and the trail ascends the high bluffs overlooking the
valley, and proceeds over several miles of table-land
till the valley of the Platte is again reached. At
this point, the trail finally leaves the Platte, and,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
ascending the bluffs on the right, passes over an arid
plain diversified with immense piles of rocks, deep
ravines and chasms, and presenting a wide-spread
sterility and desolation, for the distance of forty
miles. Water is to be obtained in very small quantities
and at few places on this part of the trail, and,
therefore a scarcity should be provided for before
leaving the Platte. At the end of that distance, the
trail descends into a small valley, where spring water
can be obtained and some refreshing shade. Ascending
from this valley, the trail gradually ascends to
the summit of a dividing ridge, from which a view of the
Sweetwater River Mountains can be obtained. Descending
from the ridge, a small stream, the grassy
banks of which serve for an encampment, is soon
reached. Farther on is a well-known landmark among
the mountains, called Independence Rock. It is an
isolated elevation, composed of masses of rock, about
one hundred feet in height, and a mile in circumference,
standing near the northern bend of the Sweetwater
River, and between the ranges of mountains
which border the valley of that stream.</p>

<p>The trail proceeds up the Sweetwater River, and
passes a remarkable fissure in the Rocky Mountain
wall, which is called the Devil's Gate. The fissure is
about thirty feet in breadth, and the perpendicular
walls on each side of the channel of the stream which
flows through it, are nearly three hundred feet high.
The trail leaves the river about twelve miles from
where it first strikes it, and then returns to it after
traversing about sixteen miles. It again diverges from
the river and crosses a broken and arid plain, which
presents but few signs of vegetation. Passing through
a gap between two ranges of granite mountains, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
first view of the Wind River Mountains is obtained.
The trail then proceeds through a narrow valley
several miles in length, the surface of which is white
with an alkaline efflorescence, and then returns to the
Sweetwater River. Continuing up the valley of the
Sweetwater, occasionally leaving the bank of the
stream and passing over the rolling and barren tablelands,
it crosses two small creeks which present good
places for encampment. Several miles farther on, the
trail crosses the Sweetwater River, and then leaves it
finally, making a gradual ascent to the South Pass of
the Rocky Mountains, or the dividing ridge which
separate the waters of the Atlantic and Pacific.</p>

<p>After the summit of the ridge is reached, the trail
passes two or three miles over a level surface, and
then descends to the spring, well known to emigrants
as the "Pacific Spring." The water from this spring
is emptied into the Colorado River of the West, which
river empties into the Gulf of California. This Pacific
Spring is two miles west of the South Pass, and nine
hundred and eighty-three miles from Independence,
Missouri.</p>

<p>From the Pacific Spring, the trail passes over an
arid, undulating plain, in a west-by-north course, for
about twenty-eight miles, when the "Little Sandy"
River, a branch of the Green or Colorado River, presents
itself, and furnishes the first water after leaving
Pacific Spring. From the Little Sandy River, the
trail passes over a plain of white sand or clay, and
within twelve miles reaches the Big Sandy River, and
passes along it for about eighteen miles, and then
strikes off and crosses the Green River, or Colorado
of the West. This river is shallow and only about
seventy yards broad. The trail then continues down
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
the Green River a short distance, and then, making a
right angle, ascends the bluffs bordering the valley of
the stream, in nearly a west course. The country
then becomes still more broken and barren, and the
trail ascends gradually to the summit of a ridge, from
which it descends to the banks of the Black Fork, a
tributary of the Green River. This Black Fork is
crossed several times upon the route, but is not more
than sixty yards wide and is very shallow. The trail
leaves it to cut off the bends and then returns to it.
The scenery along this part of the route is interesting,
but the soil is frightfully sterile. Diverging from the
stream the trail passes over a barren plain with no
vegetation upon it except the wild sage, so common
even in the most sterile country, and then passes
through a bottom of grass, offering a good place for
an encampment.</p>

<p>Near this place is Fort Bridger, a small trading-post
established by a Mr. Bridger. The buildings
are two or three rudely constructed log cabins, and
they are situated in a handsome fertile bottom, on the
banks of a small stream. This fort is about eleven hundred
miles from Independence, Missouri. From Fort
Bridger, many parties anxious to explore the country,
take the route by way of the south end of the great
Salt Lake. But the scarcity of water and the other
difficulties encountered in crossing the sterile plains
and the great Salt Desert should be sufficient to deter
emigrants with families from taking that direction.
Oxen could not travel fast enough from one watering-place
to another, and must necessarily perish from
thirst. Besides, the route is but poorly defined, and
may be wandered from very easily.</p>

<p>The trail of the old route, and the one taken by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
most of the emigrants, leaves Fort Bridger, and pursues
a north-westerly course, through the Bear River
valley, which it leaves at a remarkable landmark
called Sheep Rock, and crossing a dividing ridge
reaches Fort Hall, by the valley of the Portneaf
River. This fort was established by the Hudson
Bay Company, and it is the seat of a considerable
trade in furs with the Indians and trappers. From
Fort Hall the trail continues on till it reaches the
valley of Mary's River. There a tolerably fertile soil
and refreshing vegetation greets the eye of the travel-worn
emigrant. The trail crosses the river five or six
times in as many miles, in order to take advantage of
the narrow bottoms made by the windings of the
stream. The bottom is skirted by very high ranges
of mountains to where the trail leaves it, and turning
to the right ascends over low, gravelly hills. Descending
from the summit of a ridge of hills, it passes
through a valley where good grass and water can be
obtained&mdash;the valley containing several springs of
pure cold water. Emerging from this valley through
a narrow gap, the trail passes into another still more
extensive, and pursues a south-westerly direction for
about twenty miles, keeping near the margin of Mary's
River. A succession of low hills are crossed, and
another valley is reached. During the journey through
these valleys, the emigrants are exposed to the fiery
rays of the sun, and the hot winds from the desert
are very oppressive. The trail then follows the course
of the river in a direction nearly north-west, through
valleys, or plains of great extent, and mountainous
defiles, occasionally following a bend of the river
towards the south-west. The greater portion of these
valleys is barren, but there are frequent fertile spots
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
near the boiling springs. The only Indians met on
this part of the route are the diggers, and they do
not possess the power to do much harm, if they even
were hostile; but they are friendly. The want of
water is the principal annoyance.</p>

<p>Passing over the desolate valleys and hills that
border Mary's River, the trail descends into a large
circular basin, in which a place for encamping is
found, but with little water. From this basin, it
crosses some considerable elevations and then a totally
barren plain ten miles wide. Beyond this, water and
grass of tolerable quality are soon found; and there,
if possible, a supply should be obtained sufficient to
last for a long day's journey. Rounding the base of
a mountain, the trail takes a south-west course, across
a totally barren plain. No sign of the river, or the
existence of any water is exhibited. Near the southern
edge of the plain, which is twenty miles in extent,
some pools of standing water are found, and the place
is known as the "Sink of Mary's River." From
these pools to the Truckee, or Salmon Trout River,
the distance is forty-five miles. The trail is followed
over the hills of ashy earth, in which the mules often
sink to their bellies, and over a ground destitute of
any vegetation, except occasional clumps of wild sage.
A ridge of mountains is then ascended by an easy
inclined plain, and a view of the distant range of
Sierra Nevada is obtained on reaching the summit.
The intervening valley presents as barren a prospect
as the country immediately preceding it. Descending
into it, numerous boiling springs are found, which
often serve to delude the thirsty emigrants. But by
damming up the streams which flow from them, the
water may be cooled, and, although impregnated with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
salt, sulphur, and magnesia, it may quench the thirst.
The phenomenon of mirage is frequently presented to
the view of the emigrants, and it very often assumes
the appearance of things unknown to that desert
region, such as lakes, cascades, and foaming and
tumbling waters. About twelve miles from the
springs, a ridge of sandy hills, running across the
valley, is ascended, and then an elevated plain of
about ten miles in extent is crossed by the trail. Over
this plain the travelling is very laborious&mdash;the sand
being very deep. But at length the Truckee River is
reached, and water, grass and trees, larger than any
upon the former part of the route for five hundred
miles preceding, greet the wearied and thirsty
emigrant.</p>

<p>The Truckee River is about fifty feet in breadth
with a shallow but rapid current of clear water. The
bottom land is exceedingly fertile, and game is sometimes
to be obtained in its neighborhood. The trail
crosses the Truckee very frequently, in its winding
course, but the country being agreeable, this is not
considered toilsome by the emigrant, after traversing
the barren plains in the vicinity of Mary's River. The
course of the Truckee is nearly from the south-west to
the north-east, and in some places it passes between
very high mountains, affording scarcely room for travellers
to pass. Sometimes the trail is followed
through fertile valleys and then over barren hills and
rocky passes till the summit of a gap in the mountains
is reached, and a pleasant valley opens to the
view, offering a fine place for encampment. The trail
then turns to the left, and proceeds in a southerly
direction, crossing the Truckee several times, until
the Truckee Lake breaks upon the view. This small
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
sheet of water is surrounded by lofty mountains, except
upon the side where its outlet flows from it. The
trail strikes the shore of the lake at its eastern end,
and continues around its north-eastern side over a
very difficult, boggy road. Having reached the upper
end of the lakes, the trail leaves the shore on the
right hand, ascends over some rocky hills, and, crossing
some deep ravines and swampy ground, arrives at
the base of the crest of the Sierra Nevada. Then
comes the ascent of the steep pass&mdash;a work of difficulty
and danger. The mules are compelled to leap
from crag to crag, and, when heavily laden, are often
precipitated backward in climbing the almost perpendicular
rocks.</p>

<p>Having attained the summit of the pass, the view
is inexpressibly grand and comprehensive. A mile
journey upon the top of the mountain brings the traveller
to a small lake, surrounded by good grass,
which is often used as a place of encampment. Leaving
the lake on the right hand, the trail descends over
the rocky ground for a few miles, and then enters a
beautiful valley about five miles long. Through this
valley, which is called the Yuba valley, by the emigrants,
flows the Yuba River, a tributary of the
Feather River, and the scene of considerable gold
digging and washing. This is the commencement of
the gold region, and after their journey through the
wilderness, here the emigrants greet the "promised
land." From this point to Sacramento city, the great
terminus of the overland emigration, it is about sixty
miles; but the trading post of Yuba, Johnson's
ranche, Vernon, and the other posts, offer convenient
intermediate resting places.</p>

<p>We have thus sketched the general character of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
principal overland route to California, and have followed
the trail of the emigrant over all the difficulties
and obstacles which present themselves upon the
route. That there are portions of the journey which
are productive of considerable suffering, and which
demand stout hearts and strong constitutions to meet
them, is not to be doubted. But they are few compared
with the dangers to be encountered by deviating
from the particular trail whose course we have
followed. The want of water is the principal source
of annoyance towards the lake part of the route, but
this occurs in few places. The longest distance to be
travelled without finding water, is about forty-five
miles&mdash;from the "Sink" of Mary's River to Truckee
River, and this may be prepared for. It is a matter
of great importance, that the delay upon the route
should be as little as possible. Great suffering and
many deaths have been caused by delaying too long
at different camping places. It should be made an
urgent duty to get over as much ground every day as
possible, and to keep in the old trail.</p>

<p>The overland route which we have sketched, and
the route by way of Chagres and Panama, are the two
routes by which most of the California emigrations had
proceeded; but there are others projected, and some
have been followed. Many persons have proceeded to
California through Mexico; but the difficulty and
delay in the matter of passports, and the opposition
of the Mexicans to armed parties of another country
passing their territory, must prove weighty objections
to any such route. Another has been projected, and
will probably be opened. It is a route across the territory
of Nicaragua, in Central America. This will
be the shortest and most convenient route to the gold
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
region, and will absorb the greater portion of the
travel thither; but the overland route will always be
taken by those who have been accustomed to a country
life, or have a thirst for adventure. It presents
the greatest variety of scenery&mdash;some of it of a character
not to be seen elsewhere; and affords opportunities
for studying nature in all her visible forms;
and, though attended with toils and dangers, which
will daunt the feeble, it possesses the strongest attractions
for the lovers of variety, and the hardy adventurer
who has confidence in his own powers of
endurance.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<p class="center p2">
RECENT EVENTS.</p>

<p class="p2">Believing that every event which in any way
affects the interests or welfare of California is important
to those who have watched her progress and
have been astonished at her rapid rise, we will in this
and a subsequent chapter, bring the narrative up to
the time of issuing this work.</p>

<p>The city of San Francisco, in the midst of her
progress and prosperity, has been twice visited by the
destroying element of fire. The first calamity of this
kind occurred on the morning of the 25th of December,
1849. The fire consumed all that portion of the
city on and near the plaza, involving a loss, at California
prices, of over a million of dollars. Fortunately,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
it was the rainy season. If the fire had occurred
during the dry season, and the prevalence of the
furious gales, the whole city, composed, as it was, of
canvas tents and wooden houses, must have been
destroyed. The event did not materially affect the
progress of the city; for the burnt district was entirely
rebuilt within twenty days.</p>

<p>The second great fire occurred on the night of the
4th of May, 1850. It broke out in the United States
Hotel, situated on the plaza, or Portsmouth Square&mdash;the
very heart of the city. The flames soon spread
to the adjoining buildings, and several of the principal
hotels were destroyed. Nothing could stop the progress
of the fire but the tearing down of a whole block
of houses on one of the streets leading from the
Square. Five entire blocks of the business portion
of the city were destroyed&mdash;involving a loss of about
a million of dollars. To show the amount of enterprise
and energy existing in San Francisco, no better
opportunity is afforded than to look at the state of
things in that city, ten days after the fire. We extract
from the Alta Californian of the 15th of May, the
following remarks:</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">The Burned District.</span>&mdash;Intimately as we are
acquainted with the predominant spirit of energy and
enterprise of our city, we have almost wondered at
the rapidity with which the burned district is being
again built up. It exceeds the speed with which the
work was accomplished after the December fire.
Already, in Portsmouth Square, the Bella Union and
St. Charles, houses of public resort, are opened and
hourly thronged. In Washington Street, two dry
goods stores, 'La Amarilla' and Juan Cima's, are
opened and stocked, and on both sides of the way
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
buildings are nearly completed, and will be ready for
occupation by the latter end of this week. In fact,
the ruins are more than half covered over, and except
that the new edifices are not of so elegant a character
or so substantially built, even, as previously, they will
present a handsome appearance.</p>

<p>"The fact of the business season having now fairly
commenced, and the necessity of being alive to take
advantage of it, has materially accelerated operations.
The present busy hum created by the industrious
mechanic, will soon give way to the usual activity and
bustle of mercantile trade, and ere the departure of
the next steamer a casual observer would be scarcely
able to realize the devastation of the 4th inst. Notwithstanding
the immense amount of property destroyed,
which was not at all over-estimated, business
has not been so generally depressed, even momentarily,
as it was feared and anticipated. Our community
have risen again to the surface of the waters with
cork-like buoyancy, and the sad and gloomy faces of
the early part of last week have brightened by the
prosperous hopes anticipated in the future. Never
was calamity taken with more fortitude and philosophy
than in this city. And if to win success is but to
deserve, then those who have suffered will meet with
their just reward. <i>Nil desperandum</i> seems to be the
popular motto, amalgamated with the David Crocket
principle, enlarged and improved. We are satisfied
that nothing can retard or check the prosperity, rapid
growth, advancement and importance of this, the principal
city and seaport of the Pacific coast. <i>Viva</i>
San Francisco!"</p>

<p class="caption">MODE OF WASHING CLOTHES IN CALIFORNIA.</p>
</div>

<p>The annexed extract from the Message of the Mayor
of San Francisco gives an idea of the quantity of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
disease and destitution in that city. No doubt San
Francisco is the grand receptacle for all who become
diseased in any way at the mines or other places in
the interior; and this may serve to account for the
extraordinary statements contained in the Message&mdash;</p>

<p>"During the last nine months, an expense of eighty
thousand dollars has been incurred for the support of
the sick and destitute, who have been thrown penniless
upon our shores, and found friendless and homeless in
our streets, and for the burial of those who have died
without sufficient means to defray the expenses of
interment. If these enormous expenditures are continued,
(and it is evident from the rapid growth of the
population, that they must seriously increase, unless
some new system is adopted,) it will readily be perceived
that a very large portion of the revenue of the
city will be absorbed in defraying the expenses of the
hospital department alone. Something therefore must
speedily be done to remedy this great drain upon the
public purse."</p>

<p>As an indication of the vast increase of the commerce
of San Francisco, it is stated that, in six days
in the month of May, 1850, there arrived at that port
seventy-six vessels, freighted with cargoes to find a
market there. Several large steamboats have been
put upon the Sacramento and the Bay of San Francisco,
and they are reaping extraordinary profits. The
trip from San Francisco to Sacramento City was, a few
years ago, a work of some days, but it is now performed
in less than nine hours.</p>

<p>The reports from the mines continue to be of the
most favorable character. Gold has been discovered
upon Trinity River, about two hundred miles north of
Sacramento City, and the digging has proved to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
equal to that of any of the other placers. The mouth
of the river, which empties into Trinity Bay, has been
surveyed, and, being considered a very good harbor,
a town has been projected, to be situated upon the
shore at the mouth of the river. Rich diggings have
been opened near Mariposa, and on one occasion, a
mass of gold and quartz, weighing fifty pounds, was
taken from them, and sold for sixteen hundred dollars.
Several important discoveries have been made on the
Mokulumne River. Out of one hole, three men, in two
days, took the sum of four thousand dollars. It is
thought that more bullion will be obtained during the
dry season of the present year, 1850, than has been
received since the commencement of the gold-digging.
This seems to falsify the predictions of some persons,
that the gold region would be speedily exhausted.</p>

<p>The following is an account of some bloody transactions
upon the North Fork of the American River.
We extract it from the Pacific News of May 15th,
1850:&mdash;</p>

<p>"About two weeks ago, a party of Indians came
stealthily upon a few miners who were sleeping after
their work was over in their tents on the North Fork,
some twenty miles above Auburn. Before the Indians
gave any warning to the whites of their presence, they
killed two, wounded another, and then succeeded in
making their escape. On Friday of last week, a
trader, who was travelling with his team, was surrounded
by Indians when about fifteen miles above
Auburn. The arrows from their bows took effect upon
his person, and he only saved his life by a precipitous
flight. They carried off his coat which he left
in his wagon, with $600 worth of gold dust in the
pocket. They also robbed his wagon of several valuable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
articles. Upon receiving news of this attack at
Auburn, a number of men set out on horseback, in
pursuit of the Indians. They overtook them in a
valley not far from Auburn, and found a large party
of them drawn up to meet them. The Indians were
armed with bows and arrows and had one gun. The
whites attacked them, and soon put them to flight.
The Indians left a considerable number of dead behind
them, and it is supposed that they carried off
many more. Two of the whites were wounded with
the arrows of the Indians, but not fatally.</p>

<p>"It is believed by many of the miners that there
are white men among the Indians, inciting them to
hostilities. It is pretty certain that a German doctor
has been leading them on in their attacks. A meeting
was held at Auburn, last Monday evening, to
raise a company of volunteers for the purpose of
scouring the country, and making war upon the Indians
wherever found, so long as they maintain a hostile
position, and a number of men were enrolled."</p>

<p>A portion of the Indians of the eastern part of
California have always manifested their hostility to
the whites, and have taken numerous occasions to
wreak their vengeance upon those whom they consider
the invaders of their country. But the pursuit of
such a course will only hasten their own destruction.
They are in no condition to contend with the whites,
and their proper course would be to conciliate those
whom they cannot resist. The following account of
an exterminating expedition against the Indians is
from the Alta Californian of the first of June. To
our thinking, the punishment far exceeded the offence,
and the officer who gave the order for extermination,
is culpable in a high degree.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span></p>

<p>"We have received particulars of the recent slaughter
of a large body of Clear Lake Indians by an expedition
sent out against them from the United States
garrisons at Sonoma and Benecia. The tribe that
incurred this terrible punishment, comprises the natives
of Sonoma and Napa valleys, and has maintained, in
general undisturbed peaceful relations with the white
settlers of that section of California. Last summer,
however, a stubborn family Indian offered an indignity
to the wife of one Kelsey, who had resided in the
country some nine years, for which he was taken before
a magistrate and sentenced to receive one hundred
lashes. After this punishment, on the same day, we
are informed Kelsey, sought the wretched offender,
and laid him dead at his feet, shooting him in the
presence of several gentlemen, who remonstrated with
him on the barbarity of the deed. This man Kelsey
was afterwards murdered, as was also a brother-in-law,
by the Indians of the neighborhood. Since then
repeated acts of violence have been visited upon the
natives, and our readers will remember the accounts
which we published a few months since, of outrages
committed in Sonoma and Napa, by a party of desperate
white men. The Indians were driven to the
mountains, and subsequently made depredatory incursions
upon their old masters, driving away cattle, and
indulging their natural propensity to steal. Complaints
were made,&mdash;doubtless the accounts of their
conduct highly colored,&mdash;to the garrisons of Benecia
and Sonoma, and on the 1st of the month an expedition
was fitted out against them, composed of a detachment
of infantry, and a company of dragoons, under
command of Lieutenant Davidson, (seventy-five in all,)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
with orders to proceed against the Clear Lake Indians,
and <i>exterminate</i>, if possible, the tribe.</p>

<p>"The troops arrived in the vicinity of the lake,
and came unexpectedly upon a body of Indians numbering
between two and three hundred. They immediately
surrounded them, and as the Indians raised a
shout of defiance and attempted escape, <i>poured in a
destructive fire indiscriminately upon men, women, and
children</i>. 'They fell,' says our informant, 'as grass
before the sweep of the scythe.' Little or no resistance
was encountered, and the work of butchery was
of short duration. The shrieks of the slaughtered
victims died away, the roar of muskets then ceased,
and stretched lifeless upon the sod of their native
valley were the bleeding bodies of these Indians&mdash;nor
sex, nor age was spared; it was the order
of extermination fearfully obeyed. The troops returned
to the stations, and quiet is for the present
restored."</p>

<p>Here is the account of more Indian troubles.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Fight with the Sacramento Indians.&mdash;Treaty.</span>&mdash;In
consequence of depredations of the Indians of
the Sacramento valley and outrages committed by them,
General Thomas J. Green, 1st Division, State Militia,
ordered out two companies of Mounted Volunteers,
under command of Captain Allgiers and Captain
Charles Hoyt, and marched from Oro, on the 17th of
May, in the direction of Deer Creek. On the same
day Lieutenant Bell, of Captain A.'s company, with
ten men, encountered a large number of Indians,
killed five, and took six prisoners.</p>

<p>"On the 18th the command scoured the country in
the region of Deer Creek and Bear River. On the
19th, the trail to Colonel Holt's mill, where he was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
murdered, was taken, the villages found to be deserted,
and the white settlement abandoned.</p>

<p>"On the 20th, the Indians, two or three hundred
strong, were discovered within two miles of Bear
River, upon an elevated conical hill. An engagement
took place, in which eleven Indians were killed and a
number wounded. About fifty of the state volunteers
were engaged. None were killed, but Captain Hoyt,
Lieutenant Lewis, and Mr. Russell were wounded.
Major Frederick Emory (brother of Major Emory,
United States Topographical Engineers of the boundary
Commission,) was accidentally shot through the
thigh with a rifle ball. He was aid-de-camp to General
T. J. Green.</p>

<p>"On the 25th, the Indian Chiefs Weimer, Buckler,
and Pooliel, came in, by permission, and entered into
a treaty of peace between the three tribes, severally
represented, and the State of California and Government
of the United States. The treaty is sensible
and comprehensive."</p>

<p>In the following, among other interesting intelligence,
will be found an account of that which was
expected long before it occurred&mdash;the resistance of
some of the numerous body of foreign gold-seekers
to the tax imposed upon them. The license tax is
certainly a just one; but the foreigners presumed
upon their number and strength, that they had power
sufficient to resist its imposition. The easy excitability
of the Americans, upon any subject connected
with their own soil is well known; and it is exceedingly
strange that a serious collision did not take place.
We extract from the Alta Californian, of June 1st,
1850.</p>

<p>The <i>Alta Californian</i> has letters from Stockton to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
May 22d. On the Tuolumne, but little gold digging
has been effected since last fall along the banks. The
gold is under water, and preparations were making
by companies to dam the streams to get at it. This
work has been actively going on for five or six months.
There is want of men at this kind of work, and eight
or ten dollars a day is readily obtained. The diggings
at Jamestown, Sonora, &amp;c., have been partially
deserted on account of new diggings discovered at Columbia,
three miles from Sonora, at the last accounts
some two thousand persons had collected there, and
town lots were selling at high prices.</p>

<p>Sonora is growing very rapidly, being in the centre
of an extensive mining region. It is likely to be next
to Stockton in size and importance. Discoveries of
rich placers have been made in its vicinity lately;
some of the richest holes at Columbia are thirty, forty,
and fifty feet deep. A serious difficulty has broken
out at Sonora. A number of foreigners refused to
comply with the law taxing them for the privilege of
working the mines. A time was fixed by the collector
to summon a posse of American citizens to prevent
them from working. The day previous to the time
fixed, the foreigners paraded with guns, &amp;c., and reinforcements
of Americans were sent for from the
neighboring towns. A letter from Stockton, dated
May 22d, adds:</p>

<p>"In the evening, the sheriff, Mr. Work, was accosted
by a Mexican, who asked him if he was not an
officer, or the officer who intended to enforce the payment
of the license. On replying that he was, the
Mexican made an attempt to stab him, when a person
standing by, named Clark, with a single stroke of a
bowie knife, nearly severed his head from his body.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
Thirty armed Americans soon arrived from Mormon
Gulch, and the whole American population were on
the alert all night.</p>

<p>"At last accounts there were two or three hundred
Americans at Sonora, under arms, and others were
hourly arriving. On Monday the excitement had
somewhat abated. Hundreds of the Mexicans and
Chileans were packing up and leaving for Stockton.
Many of them disclaimed having had any intention
of resorting to arms, and all were evidently more or
less frightened at the aspect of affairs. It appears
that the Mexicans who took part in the disturbance,
were led on by some hot-headed Frenchman, lately
arrived from France, of the Red Republican order.
They found, however, that the majority of the Spaniards
were not disposed to join them, and it is supposed
that the whole affair will blow over without any
very serious consequences. The affair will probably
be a severe blow to business, for the present, in Sonora."</p>

<p>The <i>Stockton Times</i> has a letter from Sonora, giving
the details of this difficulty. The foreigners said
they were willing to pay four or five dollars per month,
but that the amount demanded was utterly beyond
their power to pay. They made this statement at an
interview with the Governor. The letter goes on as
follows:</p>

<p>"During the discussion, an American who wished
to get out of the crowd, began elbowing his way from
the place where he stood, when a Mexican or Chilian,
in front of him, drew a pistol. In a moment a dozen
revolvers were out, and a precipitate retreat was made
by the foreigners. No shot was fired, but the Mexicans
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
were alarmed, and the town was cleared in five
minutes. Our peace now seemed threatened by about
five thousand men outside, and no inconsiderable
alarm was created in town. The citizens armed themselves,
and expresses were sent to Mormon Creek and
Sullivan's Diggings, from which places about five
hundred well armed Americans arrived, and marched
through the streets with guns and rifles on their
shoulders. The demonstration was sufficient; the
crowds in the vicinity soon dispersed, and quiet was
restored. The only thing to be feared, is the misguided
zeal of our own citizens, who although generally
sympathizing with the discontent occasioned by
the unjust tax, are incensed that the foreigners should
presume to take the law into their own hands, and
may not be willing to allow the affair to rest where
it is.</p>

<p>A serious affray took place this afternoon, in which
a Mexican was seriously wounded. A man was
noticed parading the streets with two or three pistols
and a knife in his belt; the man was intoxicated, and
the sheriff arrested him, or rather took his arms from
him. While in the act, a Mexican came up behind
and made a stab at the officer with a large knife. The
murderous intent was frustrated by a bystander, who,
with a bowie knife, struck the man, wounding him
severely. Mr. Work, the sheriff, was happily untouched.</p>

<p>This state of affairs, if allowed to last, will ruin
the prosperity of the whole southern mines, and your
own town of Stockton will be the first to suffer
thereby.</p>

<p><i>Monday, May 20.</i>&mdash;A guard was kept up all last
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
night, but every thing was quiet, and as I said yesterday,
I believe the danger, if any was to be apprehended,
had passed away. But the excitable feelings
of the hundreds of Americans now under arms had to
be indulged, and hearing that a camp, mostly composed
of foreigners, situated about seven miles from
Sonora, had mounted Mexican, Chilian, and French
flags, (what truth there is in the report, I know not,)
they have started out this morning to avenge the insult,
and chastise the temerity of the "greasers" and
"outsiders." I sincerely trust there will be good
sense enough in the party to refrain from wanton aggression.</p>

<p>Gov. Burnett has sent Hon. John Bidwell and Judge
H. A. Schoolcraft in charge of the block of stone contributed
by California to the Washington Monument.
It is thus described:</p>

<p>"This block of gold-bearing quartz, is from the
Mariposa diggings, near Fremont's mines, and weighs
about one hundred and twenty-five pounds. In shape
it is irregular, approaching a square, its sides varying
from eighteen to twenty inches in length. It averages
in thickness nine inches&mdash;across its face diagonally it
is twenty-one inches by measurement. Very little
gold is perceptible to the naked eye, but it is estimated
to contain about eighty dollars worth."</p>

<p>Since the above events were recorded, another most
disastrous fire has occurred in the city of San Francisco.
It broke out in the Sacramento House, situated
in the wealthiest portion of the city, on the 17th of
June, 1850, at eight o'clock, A.M., and in the short
space of three hours, about two-thirds of the wealthiest
district was consumed. The shipping in the harbor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
was only saved by the greatest exertion. The entire
loss is estimated at from three to four millions of
dollars. This event occurring so soon after the previous
fire, has had a depressing and gloomy effect upon
the business operations, not only of San Francisco,
but of Sacramento City also. Many of the heaviest
trading houses have been entirely ruined; and others
brought to the verge of it. Several individuals, including
the Mayor of the city, distinguished themselves
by their noble and generous exertions to arrest the
progress of the fire and save property.</p>

<p>The emigration to California by way of the overland
route is six times as great during the present
year as it was in 1849. The last company left Council
Bluffs, on the 15th of June. They brought up the
rear of near four thousand wagons, ten or twelve
thousand persons, and about twenty thousand head of
horses and cattle. The continued success of the gold
diggers and the extraordinary prospect in regard to
the quantity that will be obtained during the mining
season of 1850, serves to keep up the excitement and
to allure the emigrant to the golden land.</p>

<p>There is a prospect that the seat of government of
California will be removed from San José to the proposed
new city of Vallejo, about twenty miles above
San Francisco, near the Straits of Carquinez, and at
the junction of the Napa and San Pablo Bays.
The new city has already been surveyed, and a
company of influential capitalists organized, with the
determination to "go ahead," whether the capital is
or is not established at this point. The site no doubt
presents many advantages for a large commercial city,
not possessed by San Francisco. The distance from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
the "Golden Gates," (as the entrance from the Pacific
to the succession of bays connected with the harbor
of San Francisco is termed) is about the same as San
Francisco. The harbor is one of the safest and most
commodious in the world, and the commissioners
appointed by the general government to make surveys
and decide upon the best location, have to recommend
Mare's Island, half a mile from Vallejo, as the naval
depot of the United States in California. The climate
of Vallejo is delightful, and the place is never subjected
to those strong and cold northerly winds which
render San Francisco so disagreeable as a residence
and so dangerous as a commercial city. There is
plenty of marble for building purposes in the immediate
vicinity of Vallejo, and plenty of limestone at a convenient
distance, and easily obtainable. The new
city will command a most beautiful view of San Pablo
Bay and of the country adjacent, and the Napa valley
(through which the Napa River flows, and near the
mouth of which the city is located,) and the Sonoma
valley in the vicinity are among the most fertile in
California. Near Vallejo are also mineral springs,
possessing similar properties, and said to equal the
celebrated Congress Springs at Saratoga.

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<p class="center p2">
THE MINERALOGICAL AND OTHER CHARACTERISTICS OF
GOLD, AND THE MODE OF DISTINGUISHING IT WHEN
FOUND; TOGETHER WITH THE ASSAY, REDUCTION,
AND REFINEMENT OF GOLD.
</p>

<p class="p2">For the purpose of presenting all that is connected
with that precious metal, that has built up a state
within a few years, and of making the reader fully
acquainted with all that is necessary for the gold-seeker
to know, we will now describe, in some detail,
the natural history, character of gold, and the mode
of determining its presence and value.</p>

<p>Gold <i>invariably</i> exhibits something of the peculiar
yellow color which it is known to possess in a pure
state; but this color is modified by various metals
with which it may be mixed. Thus it may be described
as having various shades of gold-yellow; occasionally
approaching silver-white, occasionally resembling
brass-yellow of every degree of intensity, and even
verging on steel-gray in some specimens from South
America.</p>

<p>The lustre of gold is highly metallic and shining,
and owing to the small amount of oxidation at its surface,
it preserves its shining lustre even after long
exposure in contact with other substances. Thus the
shining particles are often seen in sand when the
quantity is barely sufficient to repay the cost of working,
notwithstanding the value of the metal. Even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
however, if the surface is dull, the true color and appearance
are easily restored by rubbing, and when polished
it takes a very vivid lustre, which is preserved for a
long time in the atmosphere.</p>

<p>Although in the division which has been introduced
into gold-yellow, brass-yellow, and grayish-yellow,
native gold seems with some slight modifications
to agree with the geological relations of its
varieties, yet this mode of arrangement deserves little
serious notice. The gold-yellow varieties comprise
the specimens of the highest gold-yellow colors, though
there are some among them which have rather a pale
color; they include most of the crystals and of the
imitative shapes, in fact the greater part of the species
itself. The brass-yellow native gold is confined to
some of the regular and imitative shapes of a pale
color (which is generally called brass-yellow,) and, as
it is said, of a less specific gravity than the preceding
one; but this does not seem to have ever been ascertained
by direct experiment. The grayish-yellow
native gold occurs only in those small flat grains which
are mixed with the native platina, and possess a yellow
color a little inclining to gray; they are said to have
the greatest specific gravity of them all. The real
foundation of this distribution seems to be the opinion
that the first are the purest, the second mixed with a
little silver, and the third with platina. It is not
known whether the latter admixture really takes place,
but it is certain that several varieties of gold-yellow
native gold contain an admixture of silver.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>In color and lustre, inexperienced persons might
mistake various substances for gold; these are chiefly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
iron and copper pyrites, but from them it may be
readily distinguished, being softer than steel and very
malleable; whereas iron pyrites is harder than steel,
and copper pyrites is not malleable; for although the
latter mineral yields easily to the point of a knife, it
crumbles when we attempt to cut or hammer it, whereas
gold may be separated in thin slices, or beaten out
into thin plates by the hammer. There can thus be
no possible difficulty in distinguishing these various
minerals in a native state, even with nothing but an
ordinary steel knife. From any other minerals, as
mica, whose presence has also misled some persons,
gold is easily known by very simple experiments with
a pair of scales, or even by careful washing with water,
for gold being much heavier than any other substance
found with it (except platina and one or two extremely
rare metals,) will always fall first to the bottom, if
shaken in water with mud, while mica will generally
be the last material to fall. This is the case,
however fine or few the particles of either mineral
may be.</p>

<p>Gold therefore can be distinguished by its relative
weight or specific gravity, and by its relative hardness,
from other bodies which resemble it. It is described
generally as soft, completely malleable and flexible,
but more accurately as softer than iron, copper or
silver, but harder than tin or lead. It is useful to
know facts of this kind, as a simple experiment that
can be made with instruments at hand, is often more
valuable than a much more accurate examination
requiring materials not immediately available. Thus
if it is found that a specimen (perhaps a small scale or
spangle) is readily scratched by silver, copper or iron,
and scratches tin and lead, it may, if of the right
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
color and sinking rapidly in water, be fairly assumed
to be gold.</p>

<p>The weight of gold, as of all substances, it is convenient
to estimate relatively, and in comparison with
the weight of an equal volume of water. The relative
weight, or <i>specific gravity</i>, as it is called, of gold, is
remarkably high, the lightest varieties being twelve
times heavier than water, and pure gold nineteen
times. This is expressed by saying that the specific
gravity of native gold is 12-19, and the number
determined by comparing the weight of the mineral in
water and air.</p>

<p>As the value of gold depends almost entirely on its
specific gravity, and this test, therefore, is of the
greatest practical importance, it will not be out of
place if we here explain some very simple apparatus
for the determination of this point.</p>

<p>If the specimen then is large enough to be suspended
conveniently by a thread, weigh it first in air
by a fine balance, expressing the result in grains, and
taking care previously to remove dust or loosely adhering
particles. Then suspend it by a horsehair from
the scale-pan (it is convenient to have a hook attached
to it for this purpose,) and thus suspended, immerse
it and re-weigh it in water, taking care that it is
covered on all sides by at least half an inch of water,
and carefully brushing off with a feather any bubbles
of air that adhere to the surface. The results may
then be noted as follows:&mdash;</p>
<table summary="Calculation of Weight">

<td>&nbsp;</td>

<td class="tdru">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdr">Difference</td>

</table>

<p>This result gives the weight of a bulk of water
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
equal to that of the specimen, and by dividing the
weight of the specimen in air by this number, the
specific gravity is obtained.</p>

<td rowspan="2">Specific gravity = </td>
<td class="tdcu">weight of substance in air</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdc">weight of equal bulk of water</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>If, however, the substance is in the form of fine
sand, or very small lumps, it is better, after weighing
it carefully, to take a small dry phial furnished with a
stopper; counterpoise this phial accurately in the
weight-scale by shot or strips of lead, then fill it completely
with pure water, taking care that no bubbles
of air are left in, and weigh the quantity of water it
contains: afterwards empty the bottle and dry it
inside.</p>

<p>Next fill the bottle about two-thirds full of the
powder to be examined, weigh this and record the
weight. Then fill the bottle once more with water,
taking care, as before, that all bubbles are expelled
and none of the powder washed out. Once more
weigh it.</p>

<p>We have then to make the following calculation:</p>

<p>By the help of this table the value<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> of auriferous
sand may also be in some degree estimated, since, as
will be seen, the specific gravity of most of the sands
is under 3, while that of the most impure gold is 12;
so that if the specific gravity of the sands themselves,
when experimented on, is much greater than
that of ordinary sand, it is likely that the excess will
be for the most part gold, in a district otherwise known
to be auriferous: the greater the specific gravity, too,
the greater probability there is, of this being the cause.
It may also be worth while to mention here, that the
specific gravity of those pepitas or lumps of gold which
present a fine yellow color varies generally from 14-7/10
to 18-8/10; but when much paler they may range as low
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
as 12-1/2, which is that of a mineral called <i>electrum</i>,
which will be described presently, and which is a mixture
of silver and gold.</p>

<p>When a piece of gold is broken (which is not done
without difficulty&mdash;greater in proportion to its purity,)
the fractured edges are very uneven and torn, exhibiting
a peculiar fibrous appearance, known to mineralogists
as "fine hackly." This fracture indicates that
the mineral is <i>torn asunder</i> and not really broken,
and is a proof of considerable toughness.</p>

<p>The form in which gold is found is various. It is
sometimes crystalline, in eight or twelve-sided regular
figures, passing into cubes, but the crystals are generally
small and rare. In case of such crystals being
found, it is well worth knowing that they possess a
value as mineral specimens far beyond that of the
gold which they contain.</p>

<p>More frequently the metal is found in lumps or
grains, called by the Spaniards <i>pepitas</i>, varying in
size from that of a pin's head to masses weighing, as
has been already mentioned, nearly one hundred
pounds troy. The term <i>pepita</i> is only applied to
grains of some magnitude, and the most common
limits of size are from that of a small pin's head to
that of a nut or gooseberry.</p>

<p>When much smaller and still rounded, they are
called <i>gold dust</i>, and when flattened, <i>scales</i> or <i>spangles</i>.
In nature, and when seen in veins of quartz,
gold often occurs <i>foliated</i>, or in leafy expansions of
extreme thinness, or in branchy (<i>dendritic</i>) forms,
probably made up of minute crystals. It is in the
form of very minute grains that the metal is generally
disseminated through rocks and auriferous ores of
various metals, and these are reduced according to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
circumstances in methods that will be alluded to in a
future chapter. In pepitas and small grains it is carried
down by streams and deposited in their beds, the
pepitas being usually most abundant where there is
reason to suppose considerable disintegration of the
surface, and where the action of denuding causes to a
great extent is evident. The coast of Africa and the
rivers of Europe are examples of the former case,
while the Siberian deposits and those of California
would appear to belong to the latter.</p>

<p>The following are examples of the constituent parts
of various specimens of gold obtained from different
gold districts, and will form a useful guide for comparison.</p>

<p>The gold from California, according to the assay
of Mr. Warwick of New York, yields 89·58 per cent,
pure gold, and is therefore, about equal to that obtained
from the washings of Miask (the richest district
in Western Siberia, and that producing the largest
pepitas,) and superior, as the assayer remarks, to the
gold dust from Senegal.</p>

<p>There is a remarkable mixture of native gold with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
silver occasionally found in Siberia, and known under
the name of <i>electrum</i>. Its color is pale brass-yellow,
passing into silver-white. It occurs in small plates
and imperfect cubes, and possesses many of the characters
of gold, but it consists only of 64 per cent. of that
metal, and 36 per cent. silver. It is at once known
by its low specific gravity, which does not exceed 12.</p>

<p>Other mixtures of gold are (1) a <i>rhodium-gold</i>
found in Mexico, and containing 34 to 43 per cent. of
rhodium, having a specific gravity of 15½&mdash;16·8, and
a clear, dirty yellow color; and (2) a <i>palladium-gold</i>
(containing 9·85 per cent. palladium, and 4·17 per
cent. silver) found in Brazil and elsewhere in South
America, in small crystalline grains of pale yellow
color. The auriferous ores of tellurium, including
silver, have hitherto only been found in Transylvania.
Their color is steel-gray, and they tarnish on exposure.
The variety called graphic-gold, or graphic tellurium,
consists of about 60 per cent. of tellurium, 30 per cent.
gold, and 10 per cent. silver, and is worked chiefly
as an ore of gold. Another variety, "yellow gold
glance," yields somewhat less tellurium, gold and
silver, and as much as 20 per cent. of lead.</p>

<p>Having now explained at some length the more
manifest characteristics of gold, namely, its color,
hardness, and specific gravity, it is necessary, before
explaining the mode of separating it from associated
minerals, that we should here give some account of
the behavior of this metal under the blowpipe, and
when exposed to simple chemical tests. The assay
of gold and its accurate analysis, we postpone for the
present.</p>

<p>The method of blowpipe analysis, although exceedingly
useful, is not absolutely necessary in the case
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
of gold, because of the many readier ways of determining
the metal, but it seems advisable to state the
appearances presented. All the varieties are readily
fusible into a globule, which when the gold is pure, is
unaltered by the continuance of the heat. In this
respect it differs entirely from iron and copper pyrites,
which, on being exposed to the flame, give off sulphur
fumes and undergo considerable change. In the case
of gold containing other metals, these, with the exception
of silver; may generally be got rid of by continuing
the heat in the exterior flame with the addition
of a little nitre. Before the oxy-hydrogen blowpipe,
the metal is volatilized in the form of a purple
oxide.</p>

<p>Gold is not acted on by any of the acids alone.
When exposed to the mixture of nitric with hydrochloric
acid (in the proportion of one part nitric to four
of hydrochloric) called <i>aqua regia</i>, it dissolves without
residue, the solution giving a purple precipitate with
protochloride of tin, and a brown precipitate with protosulphate
of iron. Electrum, the mixture of silver
with gold above alluded to, is only partially soluble in
aqua regia, giving a residue of chloride of silver. The
solution is acted on by protosulphate of iron, as already
explained.</p>

<p>The following simple mode of detecting attempts
at imposition in gold dust is worthy of being recorded
in this place.</p>

<p>Place a little gold dust in a glass tube or earthenware
saucer, and pour nitric acid upon it; then
hold the glass or saucer over a flame, or upon a few
embers, until red flames (nitric vapors) arise; if it
be pure gold, the liquid will not become discolored;
but if pyrites or brass-filings should have been mixed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
with it, the acid will become turbid, green, and black,
discharging bubbles of gas. After the ebullition has
ceased, the residue should be washed with water, and
acid again poured upon it, when the same effect may
be observed, but in a less degree; and if the experiment
be repeated till all effervescence ceases, it will
finally leave the gold dust pure.</p>

<p class="center p2">
ADDITIONAL RECENT EVENTS.
</p>

<p class="p2">The history of the laws of a State affords the best idea
of its social condition&mdash;present and prospective; for
they are framed from the necessity of circumstances
and the demands of the inhabitants. We may, therefore,
see the condition and the progress of the Californians
in their legislative transactions.</p>

<p>The California Legislature adjourned on the 22d
April. They have passed a law creating a State
assayer, until a mint be established in California.
Among the one hundred and forty-three acts and
joint resolutions passed, we notice the following:</p>

<p>To incorporate the cities of Benecia, San Diego, San
Jose, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Sonoma, and Santa
Barbara, and a general act for the incorporation of
cities; concerning the State revenue, etc., and its management;
creating loans temporarily, appropriations,
and other fiscal acts; relating to the appointment of
pilots, regulating the duties of harbor masters, declaring
certain rivers, etc., navigable, creating health
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
officers for San Francisco, creating a marine hospital,
regulating quarantine at San Francisco, providing for
the inspection of steamboats; subdividing the State
into counties, establishing county seats and providing
for the complete organization of all the counties; organizing
the supreme court, providing for the early publication
of the laws, organizing district courts throughout
the State, establishing a municipal court in San
Francisco, abolishing all laws in force in the State, except
such as were passed by this Legislature, adopting
the common law, regulating the interest of money,
public ferries, notaries public, jails and jailers,
limited partnerships, roads and highways, public elections,
volunteer companies, wills, militia, liens of
mechanics and others, descents and distributions, bills
of exchange and promissory notes, constables, coroners,
guardians, fraudulent conveyances and contracts,
the rights of husband and wife, incorporation of colleges,
marriages, auctioneers, government and protection
of the Indians, settlement of the estates of deceased
persons, proceedings against debtor by attachment;
creating the office of State assayer, melter
and refiner of gold, to regulate Senatorial and Assembly
districts, prescribing the mode of maintaining
and defending possessory actions on lands belonging
to the United States; to prevent the importation of
convicts; for the better regulation of the mines and the
government of foreign miners, the national Washington
monument, pay of chaplain, the Pacific railway, and
concerning grants of land by the General Government
to commissioned officers who served in the late
war with Mexico.</p>

<p>Here we have all the machinery necessary for the full
regulation of a large, commercial, agricultural, manufacturing,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
and mining community. The session of the
Legislature must have been laborious, indeed; but
the members have acquitted themselves of their arduous
duties rapidly and well. One great measure
adapted by the Legislature was the substitution of
the common law for the uncertain civil law which
existed in California when ceded to the United States.
The whole legal administration will now conform to
that of most of the other States of the Union. The
provisions in the Constitution for the purpose of education,
have been nobly carried out by an act for the
incorporation of colleges.</p>

<p>Agriculture in California appears to be improving,
and as it is getting to be as profitable as any thing
else, it is attracting increased attention. Boxes of
garden seeds which had cost nine dollars, have been
sold for one hundred dollars, and scythes which cost
three dollars, sold for forty-five dollars. The seeds
which were sent around Cape Horn, were almost useless,
while those which went over the Isthmus, hermetically
sealed, came up first. One man near San
Jose, has made fifty thousand dollars by raising potatoes.
What toil in digging and washing gold would
be necessary to realize that amount!</p>

<p>Among the recent mining incidents, the following
is remarkable:&mdash;Last winter, three men accidentally
struck upon a rich deposit of gold, in a gulch about
twelve miles from Knight's Ferry, on the Stanislaus
River, and four or five miles back from it. They
worked this vein with great success, managing to keep
it a secret, until an Indian, wandering through the
locality, discovered the secret, and communicated it
to his tribe. The next day, several hundred Indians
fell to work, with the same success; but as they spent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
their earnings in gambling and drinking at night,
they incautiously let out the secret, and it spread
among the whites. The latter, without scruple, took
possession of the ground, and set the Indians adrift.
An alcalde was elected, the ground staked off, and
allotted to the several claimants. This gulch, although
rifled of its richest treasures, afforded good digging
for a large number of persons, for some weeks, many
carrying away, when the water failed, a thousand
dollars and upwards, as the result of their labors.
The three discoverers of the gulch, took away with
them about forty pounds of gold to each man, all
scraped up in the short space of seven weeks.</p>

<p>Imitation lumps of gold have been made and brought
into circulation in California. The State Assayer
states that above forty specimens have been brought
to his notice. They are generally in size from four
to five ounces to a pound in weight&mdash;quartz, and every
thing else necessary to make them look right, properly
intermixed.</p>

<p>It has been definitely settled that gold does exist in
the vicinity of San José. Specimens have been taken
to San Francisco.</p>

<p>Several artesian wells have been constructed at San
Francisco, since the second great fire, and it is thought
that others will soon add to the comfort and convenience
of the people of that city. The want of good
water for drinking purposes, has been the most serious
objection to San Francisco as a place of residence;
and additional incentive to exertion in the matter is
furnished by the constant apprehension of destructive
fires.<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247"></a></span></p>

<p>Coal has been discovered in California, in various
places, and is reported to abound in considerable
quantities in the neighborhood of San Francisco.
Every day developes some new wealth of this land of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
treasure, and we regard the discovery of the abundance
of coal as in the highest degree important to the residents
of California. Even amid the news of the
extraordinary yield of the gold region during the
present year, 1850, when a single vessel, in one trip,
brings $2,000,000 worth of gold dust to the United
States we can pause to notice the discovery of the
more useful substances.</p>

<p>The Trinity River and Humboldt Harbor, in the
north-western part of California, have lately become a
resort for the superfluous population of the Sacramento
and San Joaquin regions. The harbor is pronounced
a very good one, and the discovery of abundance of
gold on the branches of Trinity River, will, doubtless,
contribute to the building of a large town upon its
shores.</p>

<p>In the middle of June, there was much excitement
in San Francisco, caused by the reported discovery
of a gold lake, among the mountains between the South
Fork of Feather River and the Yuba. One man was
said to have got $7000 in four days, and a party of
ten Kanakas were reported to have got $75,000 in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
week. A vast number of people were by this means
attracted to the sources of the Feather and Yuba
Rivers, and though they found the lake story a hoax
of a vile character, they found tolerably fair diggings,
which would console them for their disappointment.</p>

<p>The following extract from the Placer Times of
the 17th of July, 1850, under the head of "Great
Discoveries of Gold&mdash;Gold Lake," will afford the
reader a lively conception of the degree of excitement
caused in California by every new announcement of
a newly discovered locality abounding in gold:</p>

<p>"We were inclined to give only an average degree
of credit to stories that have reached us during the
past few days, of the unprecedented richness which
this locality has developed. A few moments passed
in Marysville on Saturday, convinced us that there is
much more show of reality in this last <i>eureka report</i>,
than usually attaches to the like. In a year's experience
of local excitements from the same cause, we
have seen none equal to what now prevails in that
town. It has visited all the inhabitants indiscriminately,
lawyers, doctors and judges, traders, teamsters,
mechanics and gamblers. Our readers know we are
the last to justify the circulation of unfounded or
exaggerated reports, but we deem it right to conceal
nothing of what may prove (for aught that we can see
to the contrary) one of the most astounding discoveries
in the modern history of diggings. The specimens
brought into Marysville are of a value from $1600
down. Ten ounces is reported as no unusual yield to
a panfull, and the first party of sixty, which started
out under the guidance of one who had returned successful,
were assured that they would not get less than
$500 each per day. We were told that the previous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
morning two hundred had left the town with a full
supply of provisions and four hundred mules. Those
who could not go were hiring others in their stead.
The length of the journey and the quantity of provisions
required, there being no stores in the region,
rendered an outfit rather expensive. Mules and
horses had doubled in value, and $400 were considered
no more than enough to furnish a proper start.</p>

<p>The distance to Gold Lake was first reported two
hundred miles; the best informed, however, say that
it is but little more than half of that. It lies at a
very considerable elevation among the mountains that
divide the waters of the South Fork of Feather from
those of the north branch of the Yuba. The direction
from Marysville is a little north of east. The story
has of course spread ere this far and wide among the
miners high up on the Feather and Yuba, and the
spot will be as crowded as all other good places are,
ere the tardy adventurer from this region could reach
it. The region of the Gold Lake wonders is a new
one, however, and lies between what are established
to be diggings of unsurpassed richness. It is our
belief that it is better for one who has got some initiation
into the gold mysteries, (if there be any,) not to
be content in old 'used up' localities, but to push along
to the great field yet unexplored; and that, though
the search be long and laborious, the <i>big lift</i> is ultimately
pretty sure for those who are patient and persevering."</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_260.jpg" width="550" height="347" alt="MONTEREY." />
<p class="caption">MONTEREY.</p>
</div>

<p>The same paper of July 18th, contains additional
particulars, having a tendency to add plausibility to
the reports. Among other things, a man by the name
of McLelland came into Marysville on the 17th, with
$7000, the result of four days' labor at Gold Lake.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
Whatever may be the truth of the reports, there is no
doubt of one thing&mdash;the whole population of Marysville
and its vicinity have become infected by the news,
and are taking up their march thitherwards in crowds.</p>

<p>The Transcript speaks rather doubtingly on the
subject; it says&mdash;"The reports come as a general
thing, through teamsters and other persons whose
interest it is to give as favorable accounts as possible.
The statements are very conflicting."</p>

<p>To this we may add the statement of a gentleman
who reached this city from Marysville, direct, on
Tuesday night. The excitement, he says, is great;
but no one could give any definite information of the
locality or of its productiveness. Yet all seemed to
think there was no doubt in the matter, and as many
as could get away were starting, or getting ready to
push for the new El Dorado. Upon his way down, on
board the boat, he conversed with a man who professed
to have explored that region lately, although he did
not claim to know where Gold Lake was. But between
the North Fork of the Yuba and Feather Rivers, at
the foot of the great chain of mountains, he reported
a series of lakes of various dimensions, and "two
thousand people," prospecting all about. The snow
was very deep&mdash;"six feet"&mdash;and but little gold.</p>

<p>The following extract from the Placer Times, is the
most positive information within our knowledge.</p>

<p>On the arrival of the "Lawrence," yesterday, from
Marysville, we received more news of the Gold Lake
excitement, now prevailing in those parts. It promises
to spare no one. Many who would not be
understood to have yielded to it, seek, under various
pretences, to get away&mdash;some pleading business in
other quarters of the mines; others desiring the recreation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
of a country jaunt. It is reported that, up to
Thursday last, two thousand persons had taken up
their journey; that many who were working good
claims, and had made considerable progress, were
deserting them for the new discovery. Mules and
horses were almost impossible to be obtained. A
supply from this quarter was expected daily, and most
anxiously awaited. Although the truth of the report
rest on the authority of but two or three who have
returned from Gold Lake, yet but few are found who
doubt their marvellous revelations. The first man
who came into Marysville took out a party of forty as
guide, on condition they paid him one hundred dollars
each if his story was verified, and offering his life as a
forfeit for any deception.</p>

<p>"This party, it is understood, came near losing their
way, from the difficulty the guide found in retracing
his path, after the snow had melted. Fortunately,
however, they encountered another man, who was on
his way returning, and he showed the track. The
second person has since left with a much larger party,
who are to give him two hundred dollars each, and
the same forfeit is provided. The spot is described
as very difficult of approach, and it is feared that
many will lose their way. A party of ten Kanakas
are reported to have wintered at Gold Lake, subsisting
chiefly on the flesh of their animals. They are
said to have taken out about $75,000 the first week.
The lake is not large, and, after the wet season ceases,
has no outlet; at present, however, the water runs
over the basin, and finds its way into the North Fork
of Feather River. At a lower stage, it admits of
easy drainage, and the undertaking is already projected.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course the most extravagant anticipations are
founded on the result of this work, induced by the
yield from the borders of the lake which have already
been realized. The "placer" proper is very limited,
and little encouragement is given as to the character
of the surrounding country; indeed, it is probably
entirely unexplored, as the region lies about as far
up among the snows as the most adventurous have yet
penetrated."</p>

<p>The Yuba River is destined to be thoroughly rifled
of its wealth. Three miles above the new town of
Lina, a company has turned the river from its course,
and made it run through a lateral slough. Prospecting
of the bed has proved very satisfactory, and the
shares in the company's stock have sold at a high rate.</p>

<p>As was apprehended, various difficulties have occurred
between the owners of land at Sacramento City,
and a large number of squatters upon it. The ground
was bought and surveyed, and the title to ownership
was perfect. But the number of emigrants who
arrive at Sacramento at particular seasons forces
them to encamp outside of the regularly built town,
and when thus encamped, they consider themselves
as settlers, and are unwilling to give up possession of
the ground. The power of the law has been called
into requisition several times to eject these squatters.</p>

<p>The emigrants to California by way of the Great
Salt Lake route have endured terrible hardships during
the present year. The rigors of the season, and the
want of water, have been but secondary matters. The
Indians, always unfriendly, have been particularly
hostile, and several battles between them and the emigrants
have taken place. In one of the battles, thirty
Indians were killed, while the whites had several
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
wounded, but none killed. It is supposed that the
assailants belonged to the Utahs. The Salt Lake
City is the great refuge of the belated emigrants upon
that route, and the Mormons are hospitable to all who
visit them for shelter, or for mere curiosity.</p>

<p>The great body of the emigrants continue to take
the old route, which we have elsewhere described, and
find that it is the safest and shortest of the land
routes. Judging from the statements of the number
of emigrants who have passed Fort Laramie this season,
we should say, that the route could scarcely be
called a wilderness, when it is impossible to travel
thirty miles without meeting with parties and families
of whites. Part of this tide of emigration will flow
to Oregon, no doubt, on account of the fertile lands
to be there obtained; but the golden land will get the
bulk of it.</p>

<p>In a recent tour through the region bordering on
Moqueleme River, in California, a couple of gentlemen
from Stockton, discovered a cave or grotto of
great extent. They found that it contained large
quantities of stalactite, and saw evidences of gold.
The Indians who accompanied the gentlemen were
horror stricken at their audacity, when they entered
a cave which tradition said no man returned from
alive. The skeleton of a human being was found at
some distance from the opening.</p>

<p>An event has occurred which will no doubt exercise
a great influence on California affairs. This is the
discovery of the existence of abundance of gold in
Oregon territory. The discovery created great excitement
through the various cities and towns of
Oregon, and the northern towns of California. That
which is exhibited, shows an entirely different character
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
to any of that dug in the mines of California. It
contains large quantities of platina, and is said to be
of a richer character. The mines just discovered are
situated about two hundred miles from Oregon City.
The consequences of this discovery may be easily apprehended.
Oregon will secure a larger share of the
emigration from the Atlantic States than she had
before, and her progress will be rapid, for her soil and
climate render the country an attractive place of residence.
But will the progress of California be less
rapid in consequence of this? We think not. The
united attractions of the two territories will operate
for the benefit of both, and only tend to increase the
quantity of emigration.</p>

<hr class="l15" />
<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<p class="center p2">
A GENERAL VIEW OF CALIFORNIA AT THE PRESENT TIME.
</p>

<p class="p2">We have followed the narrative of the events in the
history of California up to the present time. We
have traced her progress from her first settlement up
to the time when she appears as a sovereign republican
State; and we have seen the effects of her vast
metallic wealth working wonders in a short space of
time. We have seen her towns before and after the
gold discovery, and marked the contrast; and we have
seen her territory become thickly peopled, and her
resources developed in a space of time which other
territories less favored, would require for an infancy.
We have also considered her soil, climate, productions,
and population, and exhibited each subject as fully as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
our information warranted. But in order to give a
clear conception of the general character of California
and her resources and capabilities, and to enable
the reader to obtain an idea of the bright future to
which she is destined, we have concluded to add
another chapter upon the general state of things there
at the present time.</p>

<p>California is now a State&mdash;in organization at least,
if not in being a member of the Union. The country
has become thoroughly American in its government
and laws. A Constitution is adopted as a State organization,
which bears the impress of enlightened sentiment
and just principles. The most liberal provisions
have been made in that instrument for the grand end
of public education. The power and capability of the
people to rule themselves has been recognized in the
matter of electing nearly all the officers of the government&mdash;including
the judges of the various courts over
which the State has control. The Legislature, in the
course of a laborious session, has abolished the old civil
law which ruled the country under the Mexican government,
and continued after the acquisition of the territory
by the United States, and have substituted the common
law of England and many of the States in the
Union. In taking this step, they were actuated by
sound policy. Few of those who were subjected to be
tried, or to have their suits decided by the rules of
this civil code were aware of the nature of these
rules; and from their crude and unintelligible character,
it would have been a long time before they could
have been fully or certainly informed. The old common
law is that to whose rules they have conformed
in the older States, and which is better suited to their
habits and principles of action.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span></p>

<p>But with her complete State organization, California
has applied for admission into the Union, and from
various causes, without reason, as we conceive, has not
yet been admitted to her claim. This delay, continued
through a long session of Congress, has somewhat
irritated the Californians, who are anxiously watching
the doings of Congress. The state of feeling on the
subject is clearly stated in one of the California papers;
and it is worthy of attention. We extract it.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Shall California be Admitted?</span>&mdash;We desire
once more to state calmly and firmly the grievances
under which the State of California labors, in order
that Congress, in her hesitation, which may terminate
in an open refusal to admit us as equal sharers in the
benefits, as we are of the burdens of the general
government, may not act in ignorance of the true state of
feeling existing here upon a point so vital to our future.</p>

<p>"California feels that she has been made the sport
of gambling politicians long enough. This is the universal
sentiment of one hundred thousand citizens of
this State, expecting daily reinforcements which will
swell the number to an aggregate of two hundred and
fifty thousand before the second session of the present
Congress. She feels that such a mass of men, born
under the flag of the Union, have a right to some of
the privileges which they were taught to suppose
it typified. She feels that she has no right to be
taxed and not protected&mdash;to be taxed, and not
represented, to be taxed, and nothing but taxed.
Nothing else has been done for her. We hear of
no Indian agent in the country. American citizens
are slaughtered weekly if not daily by savages on
our border. An agent of the Postoffice Department
has been sent here, but his power to put into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
successful operation a thorough mail system, commensurate
with the wants of the people, has been
effectually crippled from the want of an appropriation
to meet the necessary expenses. We are without
admiralty courts; yet the interests of the commerce
of the Pacific are centring in the Bay of San Francisco.
We are paying millions into the treasury of the
United States yearly. Our custom-house is thronged
daily with captains and consignees of vessels, paying
government dues, which eventually come from the
pockets of the citizens of the whole State; yet there
is hardly a possibility that one dollar in a thousand
will ever be expended for our benefit.</p>

<p>"This state of things is unnatural&mdash;too much so for
a quiet endurance, unless stern necessity is at the
bottom. Were there any reason why we should be
treated thus, we could patiently suffer on. But there
is none. And now a sentiment is fast gaining ground
here, that it is the intention of Congress&mdash;or a portion
of Congress, to throw us back upon a territorial organization.
It may not be amiss to state that California,
under no circumstances, will give up her State organization.
She has just escaped from the crudities and
unintelligibilities of the Mexican code. Under it, she
would still be laboring, had the action of Congress been
awaited. Neither to this state of vassalage to institutions
foreign to the habits and education of her citizens,
nor to a second vassalage of territorial government under
Congress, will she submit now. She knows her interests
too well for this. If we are driven to take matters into
our own keeping, the responsibility rests not upon us,
neither should the odium, if any attaches. Should
Congress ever come to its senses, and do what naked
justice demanded months ago, California will ever be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
ready and proud to form one of the States of the
Union; but it is asking too much that she should offer
herself a willing sacrifice on the altar of demagogues."</p>

<p>This is strongly and firmly said; and we hope that
it will exercise some influence on those to whose attention
it is directed. Nothing can be more unjust in
politics than taxation without a due compensation of
protection and of law. There is scarcely any prospect,
however, that California will be required to go
back to a territorial organization. Such a request
would be absurd in the highest degree, and none but
ultras recommend it.</p>

<p>Whether California be admitted into the Union at
the present session of Congress, or not, we may consider
her Constitution and many of her laws necessary
for carrying out the provisions of the Constitution, as
fixed and operative. We have then, in a knowledge
of their laws, a view of the character of society in
California, in many particulars, but there are others
which require further observation. One feature strikes
the observer at first glance. It is the variety of nation
which marks the population of the principal cities of
California. There may be seen the rapid, yet prudent
Yankee, with a sharp eye to the main chance, and a
ready comprehension of the consequences of a bargain
or a speculation; the cool, slow, and heavy-moving
Englishman, wishing to be sure of his game, and,
therefore, late in grasping for it; the lively and sociable
Frenchman, contrasting appearances and manners
with things in Paris; the coarse-looking German, with
a lively conception of the wealth of the country, and
a deep consideration of the means of grasping a goodly
share of it; the half-Spanish native of California, with
his love of indolence, and easy of satisfaction; the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
Chilian, with the ferocity and the cowardice of the
descendants of the Spaniards, and loving fandangoes
and riding horses, as intensely as the Californians,
the Chinese, with dirty, but industrious habits, and
the native Indians&mdash;a mean, degraded specimen of that
noble race that once were lords of the American forests.</p>

<p>At the present time, it is a matter of doubt,
whether the Americans or the foreigners predominate
in the population of California. It is certain that
the former have things pretty much their own way in
the various cities and in the mines. But that may be
from a want of unity of action among the foreigners.
The habits and modes of life belonging to the Americans
are generally prevalent in the cities; but in the
smaller and older towns, the native Californians conduct
every thing in the old Spanish mode. The difference
between the society of Los Angeles and Sacramento
City, is wide, and affords a good contrast between
the restless, enterprising, utilitarian spirit of
the Americans, and the indolent, pleasure-loving spirit
of the Californians. With the Americans, in the
cities where they are in the majority, business is the
uppermost consideration upon all occasions, and profit
and loss, and chances of obtaining a competency, the
constant subject of thought. With the Californians,
the enjoyment of the present, which alone is theirs,
is at all times a matter of prime importance; and
gambling, drinking, dancing, guitar-playing, and riding
on horseback, are the principal sources of their pleasures.
Which of these modes of passing away life
is the most philosophical, we leave to the speculative.
But it is apparent in California, that the energy of
the American character is exercising a great influence
on the descendants of the Spaniards. Their spirit is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
infectious. In some of the towns upon the coast, one
half of the buildings are occupied by persons who
have emigrated from the Eastern States; and the
contrast between their log and brick houses, and the
<i>adobé</i> houses of the Californians, is singular, and
seems as if the old dead looking trunk of the tree
had suddenly sent out new branches full of life and
freshness.</p>

<p>All the vices consequent upon a heterogeneous
population, suddenly thrown together and stimulated
to an extraordinary degree of activity, have fully exhibited
themselves in California. Nearly every body
in the mining regions carries deadly weapons of some
sort, and with the promptings of avarice, and the excitement
of passion, many shocking, secret murders,
and many open, revengeful encounters are continually
occurring. The practice of carrying deadly weapons
can only be abolished when a stronger feeling of
security, induced by a confidence in the protection of
the laws, shall take the place of constant dread. The
mining population is of as mixed a character as that
in the commercial cities; and national jealousies will
occur occasionally. The elation consequent upon successful
gold digging and speculating, leads to excess
in drinking and gambling, and these lead to frequent
quarrels and deadly encounters. The remedy for
these things is only to be found in the reaction to
which a few years will lead, when the power of the
law shall be supreme throughout the gold region.</p>

<p>The principal thing which has contributed in some
degree to influence the prospect and the labors of the
miners, is the government tax upon the foreigners
who wish to work upon the public lands in digging
and washing gold. The tax is certainly a just one,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
but many are of opinion that it is too high. A lighter
tax would more readily receive the assent of the mass
of foreigners; but whether it is not just that they
should pay a tax of eight dollars for every ounce of
gold they obtain from the land of others, is another
question. The greater portion of the gold region
belongs to the government, and was paid for by the
government. The people of the United States should,
therefore, have the sole right to occupy it; and it is
but just, that those people of foreign nations who wish
to reap a profit from it either by digging gold or cultivating
the ground, should pay for the use of it. The
effect of the tax is, that those who must pay it, either
must give up mining or work harder to reap sufficient
profit. In either case, the country is benefited.</p>

<p>The mining region is constantly increasing in extent.
The <i>placers</i> first worked still yield a profit sufficient
to reward the gold seeker for his labor, and the
frequent discovery of new ones by parties prospecting,
keeps up the heat of excitement. The region is
constantly extending towards the north. The vicinity
of Trinity River is the most northern part of California
where gold is obtained in any considerable
quantity, and the source of the San Joaquin, is the
most southern. The entire region embraced between
these two points is known to abound in the precious
metal, and is traversed by the gold "prospecters."
Of the gold obtained, a great quantity&mdash;a third, at
least, remains in the country. Another is carried
out of California by the foreigners, and the remainder
is sent to the Atlantic States of the Union. This is
but a rough estimate; but it seems warranted by the
facts of the number of foreigners in the country, and
the necessary current money of the residents. Certain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
it is, that were we to judge of the quantity of
gold obtained in California, by the amount received
in the United States, we would fall far too short of
the truth.</p>

<p>The growth of the commerce of California necessarily
carries with it the growth of all those cities
and towns which have any commercial advantages,
or which are connected with the various ports. Not
only has San Francisco constantly in her harbor a
tremendous fleet of merchant vessels from all parts of
the world, pouring into her lap the commodities necessary
to a new country and a rapid building city, and
Sacramento, the commerce of the mines continually
passing through it, but all the towns along the coast have
felt the impulse, and have become the seat of a traffic
of some sort. San Diego, Santa Barbara, San Pedro,
and Monterey, are all commercial ports, which have
become the resort of those traders who wish to
escape the crowd of competitors to be met with at the
more northern towns, and to have a pleasant place
of residence besides. Los Angeles, twenty-five miles
from the port of San Pedro is the centre of an extensive
inland trade, and from its being a delightful
place of residence, will contribute to the building up
of San Pedro in a greater degree than the commerce
of San Pedro can influence it.</p>

<p>At present, San Francisco is a city of about thirty
thousand inhabitants, and in spite of the repeated
visitations of the calamity of destructive fire, it has
suffered no stoppage in its rapid progress. On the
contrary, these fires seem to give a new impulse to the
energy and enterprise of its inhabitants, and, by impressing
upon them the utility of building their houses
and stores of the more substantial brick, to have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
been of permanent benefit. Like the water of a
rapid river, which, meeting with a serious obstacle in
its course, is checked for the moment and then, having
gathered new strength, surmounts the barrier and
springs forward with renewed energy, San Francisco
has pursued her course. The late fire, decidedly the
most disastrous the new city has experienced, produced
for awhile a general stand in business. But the go-aheadative
principle was too strong for a continuance
of a stagnation; and all the sufferers set about doing
their utmost to retrieve their fortunes. Success must
wait upon such persevering energy.</p>

<p>Sacramento City is fast treading upon the heels of
her commercial sister city. Improvements are constantly
being made to the appearance of the city and
the comfort of its inhabitants. A levee is in course
of construction, which, it is thought, will effectually
protect the city from being flooded during the season
of the rise of the river. The overland emigration
of which Sacramento is the goal, contributes to swell
the population rapidly; and, during the rainy season
the greater portion of the population of the northern
mines flock into the city for refuge till the digging
season commences.</p>

<p>Stockton, Benicia, San José, and Sutter are each
increasing the number of their residents and their
trade very fast. The first is the depot of the southern
mines; the second, the military and naval station,
chosen by the government officers; the third is the
capital of the State; the last is a thriving town, near
Sacramento, but in a better situation.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting features of California
is the number of the missions in various parts of the
State. They are and will continue to be interesting,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
because of their age, and the self-denying and energetic
labors with which they are connected. They
were the centres, established by a few Catholic priests,
from which the rays of enlightenment and civilized
enjoyment were spread to the native Indians of California.
Each mission was a little principality, with
many leagues of land attached, with some thousand
head of cattle, and all the neighboring Indians subject
to the control of the padre, and cultivating the
land for their own and the padre's benefit. In 1800,
these missions were sixteen in number, and three only
have been added since that time. They are named
and located as follows:&mdash;San Rafael and San Francisco
Solano, north of San Francisco Bay; Dolores,
near San Francisco; Santa Clara and San José,
near Pueblo San José; San Juan, Santa Cruz and
Carmel, near Monterey; Soledad, San Antonio, and
San Miguel, in the valley of Salina River; San Luis
Obispo, La Purisima, Santa Ynez, Santa Barbara, and
San Buenaventura, near Santa Barbara; San Gabriel
and San Fernando, near Los Angeles; and San Luis
Rey, San Juan Capistrano and San Diego, on the
coast, south of Los Angeles.</p>

<p>The wealth and power of these missions have fled,
and they are all, more or less, in a state of decay.
The Indians who were prospering under the care of
the priests have either taken refuge in the mountains
or linger about the old mission buildings, in a degraded
and ignorant state. The immense quantity
of land which was once attached to them has been
taken from them from time to time, and now they but
seem the ruins of former greatness. The beauty of
the country surrounding those of the missions which
are still existing, and the picturesque appearance of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
those which are in ruins make them well worthy a
visit to the lover of the antiquated.</p>

<p>The usual attendant of the American enterprise,
the printing press, has found its way to California, to
contribute to the information and convenience of the
people. Several papers are in extensive circulation
in the cities and towns, and projects for others have
been formed. The principal are the <i>Alta Californian</i>,
the <i>Pacific News</i>, the <i>Courier</i>, and the <i>Placer Times</i>.
The three first are published in San Francisco, and
the last at Sacramento.</p>

<p>The want of facilities for transportation must be
severely felt in the interior settlements of California.
Steam vessels of the swiftest and most commodious
character are the means of easy communication and
transportation between San Francisco and the towns
on Suisan Bay and the Sacramento, as far as Sacramento
City. Communication by the same means will
doubtless, soon be established between the different
ports on the coast. But railroads and canals are
requisites for increasing the social communication and
drawing the people of all parts of the State more
closely together. These, however, will not be long in
demand, after the State has been admitted into the
Union. The companies for such purposes will feel
secure in their charter, and receive assistance from
the government. There is nothing more efficacious
in binding a people together and maintaining peace
and harmony of action, than the mechanical facility of
communication. The Atlantic States of the Union
afford plentiful illustration and evidence of this assertion.
Mark the differences of habit and sentiment in
those States, where the means of intercourse between
the inhabitants are comparatively few and far between.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
The interests of the different sections of a large State
are of course, dissimilar, and produce the widest
separation of feeling and opinion, which cannot be
harmonized without the facilities of intercourse afforded
by railroads and canals. In no State are there
greater means of communication between the people
of the different sections, than in Massachusetts; and
in no State is there a more harmonious action in the
Legislative department of the government. Let the
railroads and canals be so constructed in California
as soon as possible, and the effect will be the same.</p>

<p>We have elsewhere mentioned and characterized the
different harbors of California. There has been one
other surveyed and pronounced excellent, and the
beginning of a town made upon its shores. This is
called Humboldt, after the distinguished traveller. It
is about one hundred and seventy-five miles north of
San Francisco. The river formerly called Pigeon, but
now Trinity, empties into it. The harbor is sheltered
from the south-west winds, but is exposed to the north-west.
The north-west winds prevail from November
till March, and are severe; but the south-west winds
during the remainder of the year, are violent, and the
harbor that is sheltered from them is considered a
good one.</p>

<p>The Indians who inhabit a large portion of California,
have been, and will be, the subject of considerable
trouble to the white residents. It is a matter of the
first importance for their safety, and that of the
Indians themselves, that agents should be sent among
them, with power to negotiate and settle all claims
made by them and disputes arising between them and
the whites, else, a destructive war will be the consequence.
They should be induced to relinquish their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
claims to the soil of California as far as the Sierra
Nevada, and receive due compensation therefor. But
for the want of properly constituted agents from the
government, they have been either driven from their
old haunts by the mountaineers and other settlers, or
remain amongst the whites to be a constant source of
trouble. The Shoshonees, or Snakes, are the most
numerous tribe to be found within the limits of the
State, but there are others which are more warlike and
untameable. They have all suffered considerably from
the aggressions of the white emigrants, and their
attacks upon individuals and parties are but the
promptings of revenge, which should be taken into
consideration. Lately, a war of extermination against
the whole number of certain tribes was commenced on
account of the doings of one or two of them. Few of
them are provided with better weapons than bows and
arrows, and, of course, they can make but a poor
resistance to the rifles of the white men. In illustration
of the treatment of the Indians, we quote an
account of the doings of a war party against them,
described in the work of a California tourist:&mdash;</p>

<p>"A few days before our arrival in the mines, five
men from Oregon, named Robinson, Thompson,
English, Johnson, and Wood, were murdered by Indians
while engaged in gold digging. Having but one rifle,
they imprudently left it in their tent. This the Indians
some thirty or forty in number, first secured, and then
commenced their attack with bows and arrows. The
Oregonians defended themselves some time, repeatedly
driving the Indians with no other weapons than the
stones they found on the <i>bar</i> where they were at work,
but upon reaching the edge of the <i>bar</i>, they were each
time obliged again to retreat. At length three of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
them, stuck full of arrows, were exhausted with loss of
blood and overcome; while the other two attempted
to escape by crossing the fork, one succeeding in
reaching the other side, but both finally meeting the
fate of the others. One of the warriors of the tribe
who participated in these murders was afterwards taken
prisoner, and furnishing the above narration, his life
was spared on condition that he should guide the
whites to their <i>rancheria</i>.</p>

<p>"Accordingly, on the 16th of April, a war party
was made up of about twenty young mountaineers,
mostly Oregon men, and including also the young
Greenwoods. Well mounted, and equipped with the
enormous gingling California spurs, they rode up to
Old Greenwood's for a review from the old man preparatory
to starting. Each man carried besides his
inseparable rifle, a long Spanish knife usually mounted
with silver, and stuck in the folds of his deerskin leggings;
and many were also provided with a brace of
pistols or bowie knife, worn in the red Mexican sash
around the waist. Old Greenwood shouted 'Mind the
scalps and squaws for me, and be sure you bring 'em
all in, boys,' and away they went, at a thundering
<i>lope</i>, eager for revenge."</p>

<p>The day afterwards, the party returned. They
were preceded by a party of Peruvians and Chilians,
with a number of their <i>peones</i>, or slaves.</p>

<p>"Following closely this motley group, came on foot
a body of about sixty California Indians. Warriors
and boys, squaws with <i>papooses</i> tied on boards and
slung at the back, all were prisoners. Clustered together
like sheep driven to the slaughter, they hastened
through the gorge with uncertain steps, the perspiration
rolling off their faces now pale with fright. Many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
of them were quite naked, and the men and boys
especially, looked more like ourang-outangs than
human beings.</p>

<p>"In flank and rear rode the war party, which had
left the Culloma Valley two days previous. Every
man's rifle lay across the pommel of his saddle, and
dangling at both sides hung several reeking scalps.
Among them was a dashing young mountaineer named
John Ross, who had two scalps for his share, and
sticking in his sash was the red-sheathed bowie knife,
which the writer had sold him a few days previous for
an ounce of gold dust. Used previously to sever the
rinds of pork, or shovel in rice and frijoles, it had now
been 'wool gathering' or collecting wigs for old Greenwood's
fancy stores.</p>

<p>"'Well done, boys,' shouted Grover, 'you have
given it to them this time; now, what's the news?'
In reply to this inquiry, we learned that the captured
Indian had led them the night before according to
promise, to their <i>rancheria</i>, on Weber's Creek, where
some of them showing fight and others attempting
escape, they were fired upon and some twenty to thirty
were killed. Their chief fought until shot the third
time, rising each time to his knees and discharging
his arrows, Ross finally killing, cutting off his head
and scalping him. Their <i>rancheria</i> was then searched
and burned; the Indians delivering up the papers of
the Oregon men, obtained at the time of their murder,
and confessing that they had afterwards burned their
bodies to ashes on the mountains.</p>

<p>"The subsequent facts were related to the writer
by his highly esteemed friend, Mr. Donald Grant, a
native of bonnie Scotland, who was one of our party
to the mines, and an eye witness to the scene; not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
having left on his return to San Francisco till the
following day.</p>

<p>"Arriving in the Culloma valley with their prisoners,
the mountaineers and miners had a grand revel
and jollification to celebrate their achievement. During
the day most of the prisoners were released, but a few
squaws and seven warriors were retained. The latter
were questioned and examined relative to their participation
in the murder of the Oregonians. Nothing
being elicited to prove their guilt, it was nevertheless
determined that they should die; because being bad
looking and strong warriors, it was believed they were
participators in the murders. Accordingly the consumption
of champaigne and brandy continued till
sunset. At that hour the seven Indians were brought
forth, and knowing well their fate, one of them put up
his hand as a signal, and all leaped along the valley
in rapid flight. Quick as thought the rifles began to
crack in every direction, while old Greenwood raving
around his cabin remonstrated at the deed, tossed his
arms aloft with violent denunciation; and stooping
down gathered the dust in his palms, and sprinkled it
on his head, swearing he was innocent of their blood.
Meantime, John Greenwood stood beside the old man
in stoic silence, too brave to participate in the massacre,
but too much of a crow to utter his disapproval. But
frantic with excitement the others thought only of
revenge, and the balls whistling in every direction laid
five of the warriors dead in the valley and mortally
wounding another, only one escaping unscathed. The
dying rays of the sun deserting the bloody scene, yet
lingered on the mountain top, and the smoke of the
discharge rolled in thick volume, like a pall over the
corpses of the slain, while that solitary warrior turned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
from his distant height, to gaze after his companions,
a moment in vain. But his heart quivered with vengeance,
and the thin white locks of the old man in the
valley, still mingled with the gray twilight, like the
sackcloth and ashes of despair.</p>

<p>"And this is what they call fighting the Indians!
A few days before only, we saw a young mountaineer
wild with rage, threaten the life of an American who
had ventured to suggest, that the murders committed
by these Indians were provoked by many previous
murders by the whites, and that they should be avenged
by the death of the <i>guilty</i> among the Indians, and not
by an <i>indiscriminate</i> slaughter."</p>

<p>We cannot think highly of the civilization of the
white men who take such unmerciful and indiscriminate
revenge as this. Such are not the means to gain the
Indians over to a peace. Revenge only breeds revenge;
and those who commit such slaughter in retaliation
for the murder of one or two men must look to the
consequences.</p>

<p>The great body of the travel to California is at
present by way of the Isthmus of Panama; but those
who intend to settle permanently in the State, and
who will increase the real population of it, take the
overland route from Independence, Missouri. The
shortest and best route for commercial purposes will
soon be opened across Nicaragua. This will have
many advantages over the old Isthmus route, but will
not cause that one to be abandoned altogether. Chagres
has become somewhat Americanized, and so have
Gorgona, Cruces, and Panama. Travel has been somewhat
facilitated by the addition of American boats on
the Chagres River, and the provision of the mountain
mules for the rough road to Panama, in sufficient
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
number to lower the price of travel and decrease the
delay.</p>

<p>The facilities of intercourse between California and
the States east of the Rocky Mountains will tend to
cement her to the Union by all the ties of trade and
mutual interest. The people of that State, being at
so great a distance from the rest of the States, would
seem to be alien to them in interest, and, therefore,
that an independent government would contribute
most to their prosperity. But mechanical influences&mdash;the
telegraph&mdash;the railroad and the steam vessel&mdash;annihilate
distance, and will be the means of attaching
the Californians to the confederacy. In her union
with the other States, there is her strength. She will
add much to their wealth and power, but her free
institutions&mdash;entirely American, require the support
of the confederacy which produced them&mdash;at least,
until the State has reached her maturity.</p>

<p>What will be the future California is a question
which admits of a ready answer. If she retains her
present boundaries, with her extensive sea coast, and
her progress bears any proportion to that since the
conquest, in fifty years&mdash;it is a warranted conclusion&mdash;the
State will surpass any of those upon the Atlantic
coast. For, what State has such united commercial
facilities and vast resources? Where are such internal
wealth and such splendid harbors to be found
united? It is probable, however, that the State may
be divided, after the population has reached a sufficient
number. It is the opinion of some of the members
of the present Congress, that there is too much
sea coast for one State to possess, and that has been
made an objection to her admission into the Union, with
her present boundaries. But it is of little weight at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
this time. After the State has existed a few years,
the utility of such a division as is proposed will be
manifest or disproved. In the mean time, let California
be admitted into the Union as her people have
created her, and then she will have every thing necessary
for her to go on in the fulfilment of a glorious
destiny.</p>

<p>The gold discoveries in New Mexico and Oregon
will have but a slight influence on California affairs.
Yet for that slight influence, they deserve to be mentioned.
The recent discoveries in New Mexico, would
seem to indicate that the El Dorado of the early
Spanish voyagers has been found, and nearly in the
place to which their attention was directed by the
Indians. A late number of the Houston Telegraph,
says:</p>

<p>"That preparations are in progress in all parts of
the State, for a grand expedition to the gold region
that has been discovered in New Mexico, not far from
the ruins of the celebrated city of Grand Quivira.
Gold mines have been found all along the great chain
of mountains extending from the sources of the Arkansas
and Platte Rivers, by Santa Fe, to the Puerto.
Immense excavations are shown along the feet of these
mountains, and the ruins of vast cities indicate that
these mines were once worked by millions of people.
The geographical formations of this region are so
similar to those of the gold regions of California, that
they appear to be identical, and contain similar deposits
of the precious metals. These facts have
been made known throughout Texas, and the Telegraph
would not be surprised to find that the emigration
to the gold region of Texas, in the ensuing
autumn, should exceed the emigration to California."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span></p>

<p>The "consummation devoutly to be wished" has
been attained. California has at length been admitted
to take her place as a star of the confederated republic.
The bill for that object passed the House of
Representatives on the 7th of September, 1850, by a
vote of yeas, one hundred and fifty, nays fifty-six. It
had previously passed the Senate by a no less decisive
majority. The announcement of the passage of the
bill was received with the greatest enthusiasm by its
friends, and considerable excitement upon the part
of its opponents. The most constant exertions were
made by members from the Southern States to defeat
the bill by adjournment and by numerous amendments,
but they were unavailing. California triumphed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<p class="center p2">
EVENTS IN CALIFORNIA FROM THE ADMISSION OF THE
STATE INTO THE UNION TO THE COMMENCEMENT OF
1853.
</p>

<p class="p2">Since the foregoing chapters were written, events
of considerable importance have transpired in California.
Remarkable political steps have been taken,
and disastrous accidents by flood and fire have happened.</p>

<p>The crimes of robbery and murder becoming of
so frequent occurrence in San Francisco that all
security of person and property was threatened with
destruction, a meeting of citizens was called, and it
was resolved to organize a Vigilance Committee, for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
the summary trial and execution of offenders. This
was an open manifestation of contempt for the constituted
authorities, and they protested against it. But
a majority of the citizens of San Francisco, feeling
that extraordinary measures were necessary, supported
those persons who were appointed upon the
Committee. Such officers generally abuse the extensive
authority conferred upon them; but justice
requires that we should say, that the members of the
San Francisco Vigilance Committee acted throughout
with a due appreciation of an awful responsibility.
Several persons were arrested, tried, convicted and
hung. One or two were notorious criminals, who had
often been up before the regular courts, and always
contrived to elude justice. By the certain and summary
measures of the Committee, security was in a
great measure restored, and the members then surrendered
their authority&mdash;acknowledging the entire
supremacy of the courts.</p>

<p>In October, 1851, the State elections occurred.
The contest was spirited. The Democrats were generally
successful. John Bigler, their gubernatorial
candidate, was elected by about thirteen hundred
majority over Mr. Reading, the candidate of the
Whigs. At the succeeding session of the Legislature,
John B. Weller, formerly of Ohio, was elected to the
Senate of the United States, to succeed John C. Fremont,
who had resigned his seat. Mr. Weller had
long been a prominent member of the Democratic
party. He commanded the Ohio regiment in the
Mexican war. It was believed that he would be an
efficient colleague of the industrious and practical
Senator Gwin.</p>

<p>The Chinese portion of the population of California
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
has gradually become quite numerous. They have
proved themselves steady, energetic and useful citizens.
Gov. Bigler, however, had a different estimation
of them. As they do not respect the oaths and
forms established by law for the regulation of business
in California, he thought they could not be
bound sufficiently in their bargains to suit the business
community; and accordingly he recommended
to the Legislature, that some measures should be
adopted for checking Chinese immigration. This
called forth a spirited remonstrance from the Chinese
citizens of San Francisco. They argued with much
reason, that they had conducted themselves properly
ever since they had entered California, and that there
was no real ground of complaint against them. The
methods of binding them were explained, it is believed,
to the general satisfaction of the business community.
We should think that Chinese labor would be in great
demand in California, as the "Celestials" not only
work for less than the Americans, but can endure
more toil and exposure.</p>

<p>In October, 1852, events occurred in the Mexican
State of Sonora, which the Californians could not but
regard with much interest. Count de Raousset-Boulbon,
a French adventurer, was the prime actor, in a
brief but stirring drama, in that quarter. He had
come to California in search of fortune. Being
unsuccessful, he went to Mexico.</p>

<p>At the period of his arrival there the Province
of Sonora was devastated by the Alpaca Indians, who
committed all sorts of depredations with impunity.
Count de Raousset-Boulbon presented himself to the
Mexican Government, and offered to deliver Sonora
from the red-skins with which it was infested. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
Mexican Government was ready to fall upon the neck
of M. de Raousset-Boulbon. "I am a Frenchman.
I know the country. I understand war. I will answer
for every thing," said the Count. "Good," said
the government, "we will place an army of ten thousand
men at your disposal." "Thank you," said
M. de Raousset-Boulbon, "keep your army; it would
only get in my way. Give me some muskets, and
two hundred thousand francs, and leave the rest to
me." He received the required sum, returned to
Sonora, organized a corps of Frenchmen, resolute
men like himself, and proceeded to hunt down the
Indians. The merchants of the country, delighted
with the successes obtained by their defender against
a set of rascals who had so long been masters of their
provinces, sent subsidies to M. de Raousset-Boulbon,
put themselves under his protection, and assured him
that neither he nor his troops should ever want for any
thing if he would only continue the war. The Count
closed with the offer. But the popularity of the
young general, and the success of his little army,
alarmed the Mexican Government.</p>

<p>They issued an order requiring him to quit the
country with his forces. Count de Raousset-Boulbon
replied, that the merchants and land-owners of the
country having placed Sonora under his immediate
protection, he felt it due to his honor not to abandon
them, and consequently he distinctly refused to obey
the order. The Mexican Government then sent a
frigate to blockade the principal port of Sonora.
Count de Raousset-Boulbon took the frigate. The
government sent Gen. Blanco, at the head of an
army, against the French commander. A battle was
fought, and after a short but fierce struggle, superior
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
numbers triumphed, and the French were defeated.
A treaty was then negotiated, by the terms of which,
Count Boulbon agreed to quit Sonora, in consideration
of receiving a large sum of money.</p>

<p>It is the prevailing opinion that this movement
originated in a mere restless spirit of adventure.
But there are some sagacious statesmen at Washington
and some keen-eyed politicians in California, who
regard it as having had the object of organizing a
powerful French state, which might check the progress
of the great North American confederacy.
Senator Bell, of Tennessee, predicted that such a
design would be entertained, and such a movement
executed by the French. It is well that the people of
California should be upon their guard. A republic
can have no safe neighbors but republics. There are
a large number of Frenchmen in California; but if
the Americans are vigilant there is nothing to be
feared from them.</p>

<p>On the 2d of November, 1852, the presidential
election was held throughout the United States.
The Democrats carried California for their electoral
ticket, pledged to vote for Franklin Pierce, of New
Hampshire, and William R. King, of Alabama. The
state election occurred at the same time, and in this,
also, the Democrats were completely successful.</p>

<p>About the same time, destructive fires occurred in
various parts of California. The greater part of the
city of Sacramento was laid in ashes by a conflagration,
which occurred on the 2d of November. Of this
terrible disaster, the San Francisco Herald of the
4th of November, gives the following account:&mdash;</p>

<p>At 11½ o'clock on Tuesday evening, a fire broke
out in the millinery shop of Madam Lanos, on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
J street, near the corner of Fourth. The inspectors
were counting the votes, and a numerous crowd were
awaiting the decision of the judges, so that no time
was lost in delay. With astonishing rapidity the fire
spread from building to building&mdash;up, down and
across the street, in five minutes. The Crescent
City Hotel, on the opposite side of the street, was in
flames, and being of inflammable materials and of
large size, sent the fiery torrent in every direction.
The hardware store of Pawoth, Eels &amp; Co. communicated
the flames to the brick block adjoining,
which was speedily burned to the ground, and carried
the fire up street on both sides, until it reached Eighth
street, and on the south side of J street. On the
corner side, from Brown, Kenny &amp; Co.'s brick block,
which caught from the Crescent City fire, there was
nothing to stay its progress but the Overton Block,
on the corner of Third and J streets, on the one side,
and Scudder, Carroll &amp; Co. on the other. For a
time the superhuman exertions put forth seemed to
check, and it was hoped would entirely subdue the
fire, and the boom of the powder, like artillery, that
was deposited in every building, by the hook and
ladder boys, was deemed the signal for the arrest and
staying of the fire on this line. In vain, however;
the wind, heretofore blowing towards the levee, increased
to a gale and changed to the north, thus
turning the fire broadside on, and in five minutes it
had spread to M. street.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_292.jpg" width="550" height="316" alt="CAFE RESTAURANT, SAN FRANCISCO&mdash;MADE OUT OF A SHIP GALLEY" />
<p class="caption">CAFE RESTAURANT, SAN FRANCISCO&mdash;MADE OUT OF A SHIP GALLEY.</p>
</div>

<p>From J and Third, the fire curled around Scudder
&amp; Carroll's, and extended to Dr. Morrell's drug
store, on the south side of J street, which proved a
barrier for a time. These buildings, of wood, were
built in 1849, and as combustible as powder. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
flames caught the wooden building opposite, and
spread to the rear on I street. At this time, W. R.
McCall &amp; Co.'s building caught on the roof. The
burning of their building sealed the fate of all to the
levee, on both sides of the street, and bearing down
the length of the city, the flames extended, soon
wrapping the Orleans Hotel. The buildings all around
were blown up with the rapidity of magic, carts standing
ready with 25lb. kegs of powder. The Union
office next fell, the proprietors saving two presses,
type and paper sufficient for a few days' supply.
The Tahama block, containing Page, Bacon &amp; Co.'s,
Swift's and Grimes' banking offices, saved, wind
changing, blowing directly south from them. J. B.
Starr's store also made a wall to prevent the further
spread of the fire in that direction. At this moment
the fire reached, from the levee, J and K street to
Tenth, one sea of fire, crumbling every thing to ashes.
The large brick store of J. A. Haines, the brick blocks
on K&mdash;with the exception of that of the Lady Adams
Co. on K, between First and K streets&mdash;are a pile of
ruins. The L. A. Co.'s buildings stand prominent and
erect this morning, a monument to the proprietor's
sagacity and good sense. The families on the line
below K street, were busy removing their valuables
and furniture, when the flames crossed the brick barrier,
and swept with remorseless fury down and across,
licking with its forked tongue from street to alley,
apparently shrivelling the wooden buildings with a
single breath. The inmates of the hospital, seventy
in number, were taken in season to the levee, and
from thence to a suitable house, by Drs. Briarly and
Williams. The City market, filled with hay, and the
hospital, were the last on that line of the fire, where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
the citizens effectually stopped its further progress.
On F street the brick building of Reynolds &amp; Co.
made but a light barrier, the roof falling in almost
immediately, with three of No. 3's engine men, who
were burned to death. Every thing to Eighth street,
on the north, and Ninth Street on the south side of
J street to Twelfth street, on K down to N street on
the southeast, through N and M to the levee&mdash;the
El Dorado, supposed impregnable hitherto, as also
Merritt's, Dr. Morrill's, Scudders', and Case &amp; Co.'s
are completely gutted.</p>

<p>Thus far the number of lives ascertained to be lost
are six. Three of No. 3's Engine Company's men,
who fell with the roof of Reynolds &amp; Co.'s building,
were swallowed up alive; the confusion of the morning,
and the scattering of people, prevented a roll call
to ascertain the names of the gallant but unfortunate
firemen. A lady, next door to the place where the
fire originated, is also reported burnt. The number
scorched is enormous, all of whom, however, are carefully
attended to by surgeons on board the Camanche.
Every assistance possible was proffered by the captains
and agents of the steamers, whose vessels were soon
crowded with females. The levee was strewn with
merchandise of every description, and the wind blowing
from the northwest threw the sparks from the
goods and saved them all. At 5 <span class="s08">A.M.</span>, the fire had
nearly ceased, the smouldering embers throwing huge
clouds of smoke and lurid flashes, bringing desolation
to the hearts of all who witnessed the sickening sight.
The losses cannot be less than $5,000,000.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 9th of November, another
great fire occurred at San Francisco. Of this the California
Whig of Nov. 10, gives the following account:&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span></p>

<p>Last evening, at half past eight o'clock, our citizens
were alarmed by the dreadful cry of fire, which proved
to be too well founded, for in less than five minutes
the whole city was illumed by the lurid glare of the
flames.</p>

<p>There is much contradiction as to where the fire
originated, but it is pretty generally conceded that
it was in the upper story of the frame building on
the corner of Merchant and Kearny streets, occupied
by some lodgers.</p>

<p>In a very short time all the buildings on the corner
of the street were in a blaze, and wholly beyond the
power of human aid to save. The close proximity of
the building to the Union, on the opposite corner,
rendered the probability of its destruction almost
certain. In a very few minutes the latter building
caught. In the meantime the frame buildings on
Merchant, and between that and Clay streets caught,
and were in a blaze.</p>

<p>The whole force of the fire department were
promptly on the spot, with their apparatus, and put
into the most effective service. Never since they
have been in organization have they displayed their
unequalled energy and training as they did on this
occasion.</p>

<p>Fortunately for the safety of the lower part of the
city, there was but little air stirring, and a slight
misty rain had fallen during the day and evening,
which checked the tendency of the fire to spread
towards the bay. Had it not been for this, the mass
of sparks falling upon the roofs of the frame buildings
on the east side of Montgomery street, must have
extended it to the whole lower side of the city.
These buildings were covered with men provided with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
wet blankets, buckets of water, and every thing
necessary to extinguish the flames, should they communicate
to their roofs.</p>

<p>The fire burnt eastward to the buildings of Messrs.
Austin &amp; Lobdell, fronting on Clay street, and that
of Mr. Naglee, fronting on Merchant street. On
the north side of Merchant it took the Union Hotel,
and all the buildings fronting on that street, down
towards Montgomery, to Bolton and Barron's building.
It did not cross over to Washington in any
instance. This is the second time that the building
of Messrs. Austin &amp; Lobdell has proved an effectual
barrier to the progress of a fire, and without receiving
the least injury itself, or damaging the goods within it.</p>

<p>Nothing but the determined and unparalleled efforts
of the firemen prevented the fire from extending to
the south side of Clay street; as it was, some $10,000
damage was done to goods and buildings upon that
side.</p>

<p>The fire broke out, as we have said, at half past
eight o'clock, and it was not until a quarter past ten
that it was checked or its further spread prevented,
and the engines worked for some time longer.</p>

<p>The records of the different courts in the old City
Hall were removed, but thrown into the utmost
confusion.</p>

<p>In the midst of the excitement, Mr. Masalski, a
gentleman well known to the community as the former
keeper of the Sacramento House, rushed to the scene
of disaster, and shortly afterwards returned to his
dwelling. He was immediately seized with the most
alarming symptoms, and in a few moments breathed
his last. Dr. Guatier, who attended him in his last
moments, says that it is difficult to pronounce upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
the cause of his death, other than that it was brought
about by congestion of the brain, but what was the
immediate cause of this congestion he is unable to say
at present.</p>

<p>It is of course impossible for us to give a correct
estimate of the losses sustained, but we have heard it
variously estimated as from $150,000 to $200,000.</p>

<p>Other destructive fires occurred at Marysville,
Sonora, Stockton, San Diego and in the agricultural
districts, an immense amount of property being
destroyed. In the cities, the damage was repaired,
with an astonishing rapidity, but some individuals
were utterly ruined&mdash;the results of years of labor
being swept away in a single night. The cities of
California are now generally supplied with fire engines
and hook and ladder companies. But these
machines are not always available.</p>

<p>The mining news contained in California papers
of November, 1852, is very interesting.</p>

<p>A letter dated Nevada, Oct. 24, says that the continued
dry weather has given unusual opportunities
and facilities to miners now working in the river
channels. At the best these operations are very precarious
in their nature&mdash;necessarily attended with a
vast outlay, and frequently, where the most sanguine
hopes were entertained, the results have been most
unfortunate. The time for working in the rivers is
usually confined to a very limited period, the water
being seldom or never sufficiently low to work to
advantage earlier than September; it follows, therefore,
that every additional week of dry weather is
of the utmost value to such as are thus engaged.
Luckily for them, the present dry season has been
unusually protracted, consequent upon which, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
rivers are at an exceedingly low stage, and the success
of the miner proportionate to this advantage. On the
other hand, those interested in ravine and hill mining
(by far the greater proportion of the miners,) are
anxiously awaiting the wet season for a supply of
water&mdash;without which, all their labor is fruitless.</p>

<p>The Bear River and Auburn Water Company's
canal is so far completed as to be available to the
miners by the first rains, notwithstanding the great
expense and time attending its construction, arising
from a want of experience, and so far beyond the
calculations of its projectors. This work traverses an
extensive and rich mining country, totally dependent
upon the canal for water, which cannot be exhausted
for many years.</p>

<p>The discovery of a continuation of the celebrated
Coyote lead, in Nevada, from which so many millions
of the precious metals were extracted in '50 and '51,
is now established beyond a doubt. As yet it is not
developed to any great extent, but enough, however,
to give employment to a goodly number of miners.
The character of the lead continues to be similar to
the old mines, in appearance and productiveness.
A few weeks' further investigation of the locality will
no doubt give a new impetus to mining operations
here, which have latterly been somewhat stagnant.</p>

<p>The Sacramento Journal says:&mdash;We have been
shown a lot of the gold taken out of the Mokelumne
run, valued at $2,500, which was superior to any
thing we ever examined before. The pieces of glittering
ore were of sizes varying from a cucumber seed
up to a pumpkin seed, and all in that flat, oval shape
so peculiarly characteristic of Mokelumne gold. It
was sent down from the store of D. L. Angier, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
Calaveras county, and we are informed that the same
company of six men that disposed of it, have taken out
of the claim $36,000 of the same kind of specimens.</p>

<p>Gold has been found in considerable quantities in
the mountains back of San Buenaventura. The
existence of the gold was made known by the Indians
to some white men, who, on visiting the spot indicated,
were rewarded with six ounces of the precious metal.
The prospect is said to be good.</p>

<p>Three quartz mills have recently commenced operations
in Scott valley. We have not received any
definite information as to what these mills have accomplished,
but are informed that one of them is producing
gold in great abundance.</p>

<p>The Columbia Mining Company took out 12 lbs.
of gold in one day, and 8 lbs. at night&mdash;making in all
20 lbs. The same gentleman informs us that miners
generally in that vicinity are doing remarkably well.</p>

<p>New diggings have been discovered near the American
ranche. Those working there are getting well
paid, in coarse, heavy gold. They are making from
$12 to $20 per day to the man. The diggings are
ravine diggings, and can be worked all winter.</p>

<p>A convention of the quartz miners of Nevada
county was to have been held at Nevada on the
13th of November, to adopt measures having for their
purpose more unity of operation and greater security
of labor and capital.</p>

<p>The San Francisco papers of Jan. 1, 1853, contain
most interesting intelligence of the state of the gold
region. The following is the most important:&mdash;</p>

<p>The present winter is conceded to be the most
severe experienced in this country since it has been
populated by Americans. During the last fortnight
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
it has been raining and snowing continually in the
mountains and valleys, and we are daily in the
receipt of accounts of disasters and suffering in all
parts of the state. The waters have been unusually
high, and communication through the mining regions
almost entirely cut off, either by snow or overflowed
streams. The rivers have been swelled to such an
extent as to inundate all the low lands, causing
immense damage, destroying stock and agricultural
products.</p>

<p>The whole country between Tehama and Sacramento
city was entirely under water, whilst Marysville
was partly inundated, and though Sacramento
city was well protected by a levee, the lower portions
were submerged. The waters at the present time
have subsided, although the rains still continue. On
the mountain streams, the loss of mining implements
has been great, and all work for the present is suspended.
Bridges have been swept away, and ferries
destroyed, and some few lives lost. The southern
portion of the mining district has suffered equally
with the northern. Stockton has been inundated
partially, and property to a considerable amount
destroyed. The bridges on the Calaveras, Stanislaus,
and other streams have been swept away, and communication
with the mining towns for a while suspended.
The flood has been universal, and the waters
higher than in the memorable winter of 1849.</p>

<p>The great scarcity of provisions, and the consequent
high prices, have occasioned much suffering
and distress already, and it is feared that many will
actually die from starvation. Many miners subsist
entirely on beef and potatoes, whilst in other portions
of the mines there are hundreds who have nothing at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
all but barley and potatoes. In portions of Yuba
and Sierra county the snow was already ten feet deep,
and still falling, and the miners actually reduced to
absolute want.</p>

<p>In one place they held a meeting and forced a
trader to sell what flour he had on hand at 45 cents
per pound, and all who were able to leave did so,
thus leaving the provisions for those who were unable
to find their way through the snows to the valleys.
In some places cabins are entirely covered with snow,
and the roofs of many have been crushed in, thus
cutting off the last chance of protection. The accounts
received may be greatly exaggerated&mdash;nevertheless,
there is much suffering and distress, and it is not
improbable that some may perish by starvation.</p>

<p>A few days since, we were visited with a terrible
southeast gale, which prevailed for two days. Several
light tenements were blown down, and some injury
done to the shipping in the harbor. For a day or
two, communication by stage with San Jose was cut
off, owing to the sudden rise of the intermediate
streams.</p>

<p>Several important decisions have been rendered in
our courts, among which is the decision of the State
Supreme Court, recognizing the right of native claimants
of land to the summary remedy of ejectment
where they are disturbed by squatters. This applies
to parties who are in possession of their claims, and
relieves them from what, by a previous decision of the
court, was a necessity, that they should incur first the
expensive process of a writ of right in order to prove
their title.</p>

<p>The Land Commission are making considerable
progress in the adjudication of claims. Of these, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
most important, perhaps, is that of Mr. Fremont, to
a large tract of land on the head waters of the Mariposa
river. The Commission recognizes his claim to
the land, but does not undertake to decide upon his
title to the mineral wealth, which, as is well known,
is embraced within the limits of the grant.</p>

<p>A convention of Quartz Miners, held at Nevada,
have adopted a code of laws for the government of
those working quartz veins in that country.</p>

<p>Barley has been used for bread in some places in
the interior, and is found to be a good substitute for
flour.</p>

<p>Farmers are getting their lands ready for the crops
of the next year, and it is understood that considerable
quantities of wheat will be sown. Preparations
are also being made for the erection of grist mills,
and it is not likely another season will find us so
dependant upon foreign supply for breadstuffs.</p>

<p>There was considerable excitement in California,
during the latter part of December, about a supposed
monopoly of flour. The article had been very scarce
and high for some time, and the exorbitant rates it
commanded were attributed in a great measure to an
organized effort to force up prices. Indignation meetings
were held in the interior, and in San Francisco
several of the public prints endeavored to expose the
supposed plots of the speculators. The timely arrival
of cargoes from Chili and elsewhere, however, soon
caused a decline, and the excitement on the subject
consequently abated.</p>

<p>Vallejo has been made the capital of the state. It
possesses many advantages of situation, and promises
to be a large city. If the government should continue
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
to have its seat there, Vallejo may prove a formidable
rival to San Francisco.</p>

<p>At Sacramento city much alarm prevailed, in consequence
of the rise of the water in the river and its
tributaries. The papers say:&mdash;</p>

<p>The warm and unprecedented heavy rains of the
last forty-eight hours have brought down upon us an
avalanche of water from the snowy regions skirting
the forks of the American River, and swollen the
latter stream to a greater height than at any former
period of the present season.</p>

<p>At 9 o'clock, yesterday morning, the water was
even with its natural banks, and soon after commenced
percolating through the unfinished embankments
at the gaps of the old levee. These were
speedily torn away by the force of the current, and
the water, now running on unobstructed through the
breach of the new levee, and so on down towards the
city.</p>

<p>By dusk last evening, that portion of the town
lying south of J and east of Fifth street, was entirely
submerged, to the depth of from one to three feet.
During the whole of yesterday the rain poured down
in torrents, and the weather was warmer than we
have known it for a month past. The American
river continued to rise, up to a very late hour, and,
at last accounts, was eleven and a half feet higher
than on Wednesday.</p>

<p>It is useless to deny the fact that the highest mark
has not yet been reached, for there is a great body
of snow that, under the influence of the present
storm, must dissolve, and find its way to the Sacramento.
The latter stream also rose steadily during
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
Thursday, but still lacks some two feet of being up to
the top of the levee.</p>

<p>There is no danger whatever of the embankment
yielding at any point in front of the city&mdash;the only
danger to be apprehended is that it may not prove
sufficiently high to retain the stream within its appropriate
bounds.</p>

<p>A small breach was discovered early yesterday
morning in the new levee, near Dudley's farm, but it
was repaired before any damage was done.</p>

<p>There was a rumor prevailing last evening that
Lisle's bridge had been swept away, but could be
traced to no reliable source.</p>

<p>Every body is busily engaged in making preparations
to meet the anticipated flood. Merchants and
shopkeepers, and all having property on the ground
floor, are raising them above high water mark&mdash;boats
are moored at the doors&mdash;vehicles of every description,
stock, grain, tents, hay, provisions and people,
are crowded together on the public square, and every
available dry nook and corner is occupied.</p>

<p>The Marysville Express of the 20th, says: "The
water is within three or four inches as high as it was
at the last flood, when it was 6½ inches higher than
ever known before. The rain is still falling heavily,
and when we consider the enormous, almost frightful,
quantity of snow in the mountains, the most alarming
fears may most reasonably be entertained. All seem
to join in the belief that the present will exceed any
previous flood known."</p>

<p>The accounts we receive from the mining districts
are really heart rending; death by cold and starvation
has visited many poor unfortunates, while as yet
the tale of horrors is but half told. It was feared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
that as intelligence should be received from the mountains,
we shall have to record the sad fate of many
more.</p>

<p>Great quantities of gold are still obtained in California.
The average value of the gold dust brought
by each steamer of the Panama line is about $500,000.
This is an astonishing production; and we are almost
ready to believe the enthusiastic declarations of the
first adventurers in this El Dorado, that the gold region
is inexhaustible.</p>

<p>Emigration to California continues to be extensive.
Most of those who intend to become permanent settlers
proceed by the overland route, from Independence,
Missouri, to Sacramento City. Late in the summer
of every year, a relief train is sent from the settled
portion of California, to meet the emigrants. Many
persons are thus saved from death by starvation.
The expense of the relief train is a consideration of
little importance, when its object is borne in mind.
Had the same measure been adopted soon after the
gold discovery, many of those whose bones are bleaching
on the plains, would have survived to become useful
citizens of California.</p>

<p>Interesting proceedings have taken place in the
United States Senate, in regard to the Tehuantepec
route to California. The Mexican government has
shown a disposition to prevent the construction of a
road across Tehuantepec, which some senators think
should be promptly rebuked. In a recent speech
upon the subject, Mr. Mason, of Virginia, said that
the acquisition of California and the intervening territory,
placed this Government in the position of having
some of its dependencies almost inaccessible. The
discovery of the gold in California, made the subject
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
of a communication with that region, of the deepest
importance, and has naturally drawn the eyes of the
world to the necessity of securing some safe, reliable,
and speedy right of way to the Pacific Ocean. Panama
has been sought, and it has been used as a place
of transit, without any serious objection on the part
of any government there. Mexico alone has interposed
an obstacle to this desired communication with
the Pacific. Mexico, from whom our territory was
derived, and who is our neighbor and sister Republic,
has alone refused the right of way to the world, and
has not only refused the right of transit to other
nations, but has also set aside an existing grant of
that right. For years, enterprises have been projected
to connect the two Oceans at Tehuantepec.
In view of the vast importance of this connection, the
minds of the people of the United States have been
concentrated upon the discovery of that plan which
shall be the least expensive, and at the same time the
most certain and efficient, to unite the two Oceans by
means of travel or transportation. Mr. Mason read
a table showing the distance between New York and
San Francisco by the Chagres route, to be 6650 miles;
between New Orleans and San Francisco, by way of
Chagres, 5675 miles; between New York and San
Francisco, by the Tehuantepec route, 4970; between
New Orleans and San Francisco, by the Tehuantepec,
3740 miles. The average time from New York to
San Francisco, by the Chagres route, was 28 days,
and the shortest 24 days. The average time by the
Tehuantepec route was 19 days, and the shortest 15.
From New Orleans, by way of Tehuantepec, the
average time would be 14 days and the shortest
12 days.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span></p>

<p>It is believed that spirited action on the part of our
government will secure from Mexico the recognition
of a right of way across Tehuantepec, which, according
to Senator Mason's able representation, is but a
matter of justice. Mexico is at present almost ready
to fall to pieces, most of its states, or provinces, being
in successful rebellion. She is not, therefore, in a
condition to resist a formidable foreign power. It is
lamentable when a government is weak, and yet
dares to be unjust. The people of California have a
considerable stake in the decision of the Tehuantepec
question.</p>

<p>The gold region is constantly being extended by
new discoveries&mdash;especially in the north-eastern section
of the state. In the meantime the old mines
continue to yield a good profit to industrious laborers.
Before the recent flood, the mining news from the
Mariposa diggings was very favorable&mdash;the miners
averaging from $25 to $30 a day. On Cottonwood
Creek, Shosta Valley, operations were also well rewarded&mdash;one
company making $100 per day to the
hand. The number of persons engaged in mining and
crushing the gold-bearing quartz is very large, and
the yield rewards the toil.</p>

<p>The miners still occasionally take upon themselves
the punishment of offenders. Recently, a half-breed
Mexican, named John Bathus, having stolen $800 in
gold dust from S. B. Star, on the Klamath, was
caught, tried by the miners of the district, convicted,
sentenced to be shot, and executed accordingly.
About the same time, a man named Morrison, having
committed a theft among the miners on Humbug
Creek, was caught, and received twelve lashes on his
bare back. These cases, however, occurred in wild
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
districts, where the laws of the State are but imperfectly
executed, and where summary measures can
alone secure the miner in possession of his hard-earned
property.</p>

<p>The Indians in the State are very troublesome, in
spite of the strong regular force kept in vigilant service.
The most recent disturbances have occurred in
Trinity County, whither Gen. Hitchcock was compelled
to despatch a company of United States troops.
Prompt and vigorous measures being adopted, the
savages were quieted. Other disturbances in that
section of the country about the mouth of the Klamath,
were terminated as promptly.</p>

<p>A late number of the Shasta Courier says, the
Indians on Churn Creek, on the east side of the Sacramento
river, have become very annoying to the
whites. They have stolen a great many mules, and
are constantly watching for opportunities to take
human life. But recently, a man named Henry Welden,
was pursued for several miles by a band of these
Indians, and narrowly escaped with his life. In consequence
of these outrages, a company of miners was
formed for the purpose of driving the savages to a
safer distance, or exterminating them. The company
was equipped for efficient service in the mountains.
The Indians fled before them, and could not be overtaken.</p>

<p>Several months previous the Indians on the Gila
were incited to war by some reckless Mexicans.
Several expeditions were sent against them from Fort
Yumas, and recently the savages have been so far
quieted, that the country is now considered safe for
emigrants.</p>

<p>Among the new and most remarkable <i>placers</i>, are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
the gold bluffs, situated near the mouth of the Klamath
river, about thirty miles north of Trinidad.
The approach to them by land is over a plain of sand,
into which the traveller sinks ankle-deep at every
step. The bluffs stretch along some five or six miles,
and present a perpendicular front to the ocean of
from 100 to 400 feet in height. In ordinary weather
the beach is from 20 to 50 feet in width, composed
of a mixture of gray and black sand, the latter containing
the gold in scales so fine that they cannot be
separated by the ordinary process of washing; so
that resort must be had to chemical means. The
beach changes with every tide, and sometimes no
black, auriferous sand is to be seen on the surface.
By digging down, it is found mixed with gray sand,
which largely predominates. The violence of the
surf renders landing in boats impracticable. When
the beach was discovered early in 1851, several tons
of goods were landed from a steamer despatched
thither, by means of lines from the vessel to the
shore. The Pacific Mining Company have made good
profits in working the bluffs and the sand of the
beach.</p>

<p>Tunneling has been carried on quite extensively in
the mining region. Some of the tunnels through
solid rock are wonderful achievements. At Duggan's
Flat, a party bored 150 feet in the solid rock before
finding the gold.</p>

<p>Professor Forrest Shepherd, of New Haven, has
made some remarkable discoveries of thermal action
in California. In one place where there was nothing
on the surface to attract attention, on digging down
the heat increased so rapidly that at the depth of two
feet he could not bear his hand in the earth, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
thermometer indicated a temperature of 130 degrees.
At another place, after wandering for four days
through dense thickets, he came upon a chasm a thousand
feet deep, through which flowed a stream, the
banks of which, on the 8th of February, were covered
with vegetation. Following up the stream, the earth
grew so hot as to burn the feet through the boots.
There was no appearance of lava, and the rocks were
being dissolved by a powerful <i>catalytic</i> action. From
innumerable orifices steam was forced to the height
of two hundred feet. The number of spouting geysers
and boiling springs, on a half mile square, exceeded
two hundred. The Professor, in the course of a lecture
delivered at San Jose, said he did not doubt that
silver, lead, and iron abounded in California.</p>

<p>The legislation of Congress in regard to California
has sometimes been of a very unsatisfactory character.
By an act passed in 1850, the Secretary of
the Treasury was authorized to contract upon the
most reasonable terms with the proprietors of some
well-established assaying works then in successful
operation in California, who should perform such
duties in assaying and fixing the value of gold in
grains and lumps, and in forming the same into bars,
as should be prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury,
and the assayer was to fix the stamp of the
United States, indicating the degree of fineness and
value, upon each bar or ingot. This was a measure
of convenience, and the merchants of the California
ports had then ample means of paying their custom
house duties. In 1852, however, Congress passed
an act, creating a branch mint of the United States
in California: and to this act was appended a clause,
repealing the act which authorized the office of Assayer,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
as soon as public notice was given of the creation
of the branch mint. In consequence of this
legislation, the Assayer's office was abolished, and
yet there was no mint for coining in the golden land.
Time was required for making the necessary appropriation
of money, erecting buildings, and constructing
machinery, all of which had not been considered.
The clause of the former act which made the stamped
ingots receivable for duties was repealed. The merchants
of California had no means of paying their
duties at the custom house, and great excitement and
confusion ensued. Finally, an arrangement was made
with the Collector of San Francisco, under which uncoined
gold could be received in payment of duties,
and then business went on as usual. Care is one of
the first essentials of beneficial legislation. The circumstance
that the people of California are so far from
the seat of the federal government, requires a strict
attention in legislators, to prevent evils which cannot
be quickly remedied.</p>

<p>The people of California seem to be deeply interested
in the construction of a great railroad from
the Mississippi to the Pacific. At San Diego, several
meetings have been held, and reports adopted,
advocating and exhibiting the advantages of a southern
route for the proposed railroad. The route which
the meetings favored is to start from the Gulf of
Mexico or some of its tributaries, and passing through
Texas, Louisiana, and New Mexico to California, and
strike the Pacific at San Diego. Its entire length
would not exceed sixteen hundred miles, whilst it
would have the advantages, as alleged by the report,
of passing through a section in which universal summer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
prevails, and of affording opportunities for lateral
roads connecting with the cities of Mexico, through
which a large trade might be obtained. The subject
has been brought to the consideration of Congress,
and that body has prudently appropriated a large
sum for a survey of the various routes proposed.

<h3>ADDRESS TO THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA.</h3>

<p class="p2">The undersigned, delegates to a convention authorized
to form a Constitution for the State of California,
having, to the best of their ability, discharged the
high trust committed to them, respectfully submit the
accompanying plan of government for your approval.
Acknowledging the great fundamental principles, that
all political power is inherent in the people, and that
government is instituted for the protection, security
and benefit of the people, the Constitution presented
for your consideration is intended only to give such
organic powers to the several departments of the proposed
government, as shall be necessary for its efficient
administration: and while it is believed no power has
been given, which is not thus essentially necessary, the
convention deem individual rights, as well as public
liberty, are amply secured, by the people still retaining
not only the great conservative power of free
choice and election of all officers, agents, and representatives,
but the unalienable right to alter or reform
their government, whenever the public good may
require.</p>

<p>Although born in different climes, coming from different
States, imbued with local feelings, and educated,
perhaps, with predilections for peculiar institutions,
laws, and customs, the delegates assembled in convention
as Californians, and carried on their deliberations
in a spirit of amity, compromise, and mutual concession
for the public weal.</p>

<p>It cannot be denied that a difference of opinion was
entertained in the convention, as to the policy and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span>
expediency of several measures embodied in the Constitution;
but looking to the great interests of the
State of California, the peace, happiness, and prosperity
of the whole people,&mdash;individual opinions were
freely surrendered to the will of the majority, and,
with one voice, we respectfully but earnestly recommend
to our fellow citizens the adoption of the Constitution
which we have the honor to submit.</p>

<p>In establishing a boundary for the State, the convention
conformed, as near as was deemed practicable
and expedient, to great natural landmarks, so as to
bring into a union all those who should be included by
mutual interest, mutual wants, and mutual dependence.
No portion of territory is included, the inhabitants of
which were not or might not have been legitimately
represented in the convention, under the authority by
which it was convened; and in unanimously resolving
to exclude slavery from the State of California, the
great principle has been maintained, that to the people
of each State and Territory, alone, belongs the right
to establish such municipal regulations, and to decide
such questions as affect their own peace, prosperity
and happiness.</p>

<p>A free people, in the enjoyment of an elective
government, capable of securing their civil, religious,
and political rights, may rest assured these inestimable
privileges can never be wrested from them, so long as
they keep a watchful eye on the operations of their
government, and hold to strict accountability those to
whom power is delegated. No people were ever yet
enslaved, who knew and dared maintain the co-relative
rights and obligations of free and independent citizens.
A knowledge of the laws&mdash;their moral force and efficacy,
thus becomes an essential element of freedom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>
and makes public education of primary importance.
In this view, the Constitution of California provides
for, and guarantees in the most ample manner, the
establishment of common schools, seminaries and colleges,
so as to extend the blessings of education
throughout the land, and secure its advantages to the
present and future generations. Under the peculiar
circumstances in which California becomes a State&mdash;with
an unexampled increase of a population coming
from every part of the world, speaking various languages,
and imbued with different feelings and prejudices,
no form of government, no system of laws, can
be expected to meet with immediate and unanimous
assent. It is to be remembered, moreover, that a considerable
portion of our fellow-citizens are natives of
Old Spain, Californians, and those who have voluntarily
relinquished the rights of Mexicans to enjoy
those of American citizens. Long accustomed to a
different form of government, regarding the rights of
person and of property as interwoven with ancient
usages and time-honored customs, they may not at
once see the advantages of the proposed new government,
or yield an immediate approval of new laws,
however salutary their provisions, or conducive to the
general welfare. But it is confidently believed, when
the government as now proposed shall have gone into
successful operation, when each department thereof
shall move on harmoniously in its appropriate and
respective sphere, when laws, based on the eternal
principles of equity and justice, shall be established,
when every citizen of California, shall find himself
secure in life, liberty, and property&mdash;all will unite in
the cordial support of institutions, which are not only
the pride and boast of every true-hearted citizen of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>
Union, but have gone forth, a guiding light to every
people groping through the gloom of religious superstition
or political fanaticism&mdash;institutions, which even
now, while all Europe is agitated with the convulsive
efforts of nations battling for liberty, have become the
mark and model of government for every people who
would hold themselves free, sovereign, and independent.</p>

<p>With this brief exposition of the views and opinions
of the convention, the undersigned submit the Constitution
and plan of government for your approval. They
earnestly recommend it to your calm and deliberate
consideration, and especially do they most respectfully
urge on every voter to attend the polls.</p>

<p>The putting into operation of a government which
shall establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity,
promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings
of civil, religious, and political liberty, should be an
object of the deepest solicitude to every true-hearted
citizen, and the consummation of his dearest wishes.
The price of liberty is eternal vigilance, and thus it is
not only the privilege but the duty of every voter to
vote his sentiments. No freeman of this land who
values his birthright, and would transmit unimpaired
to his children an inheritance so rich in glory and
honor, will refuse to give one day to the service of
his country. Let every qualified voter go early to
the polls, and give his free vote at the election appointed
to be held on Tuesday, the 13th day of November
next, not only that a full and fair expression of
the public voice may be had, for or against a constitution
intended to secure the peace, happiness and
prosperity of the whole people, but that their numerical
and political strength may be made manifest, and
the world see by what majority of freemen California,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>
the bright star of the West, claims a place in the
diadem of that glorious republic, formed by the Union
of thirty-one sovereign States.</p>

<h3>MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES,</h3>

<p class="hanging">
<i>Transmitting information in answer to a resolution of the House
of the 31st of December, 1849, on the subject of California and
New Mexico.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">To the House of Representatives of the
United States.</span>&mdash;I transmit to the House of Representatives,
in answer to a resolution of that body
passed on the 31st of December last, the accompanying
reports of heads of departments, which contain
all the official information in the possession of the
Executive asked for by the resolution.</p>

<p>On coming into office, I found the military commandant
of the department of California exercising
the functions of civil governor in that Territory; and
left, as I was, to act under the treaty of Guadalupe
Hidalgo, without the aid of any legislative provision
establishing a government in that Territory, I
thought it not best to disturb that arrangement, made
under my predecessor, until Congress should take
some action on that subject. I therefore did not
interfere with the powers of the military commandant,
who continued to exercise the functions of civil
governor as before; but I made no such appointment,
conferred no such authority, and have allowed no
increased compensation to the commandant for his
services.</p>

<p>With a view to the faithful execution of the treaty,
so far as lay in the power of the Executive, and to
enable Congress to act, at the present session, with as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span>
full knowledge and as little difficulty as possible, on
all matters of interest in these Territories, I sent the
honorable Thomas Butler King as bearer of despatches
to California, and certain officers to California and
New Mexico, whose duties are particularly defined in
the accompanying letters of instruction addressed to
them severally by the proper departments.</p>

<p>I did not hesitate to express to the people of those
Territories my desire that each Territory should, if
prepared to comply with the requisitions of the Constitution
of the United States, form a plan of a State
Constitution and submit the same to Congress, with a
prayer for admission into the Union as a State; but I
did not anticipate, suggest, or authorize the establishment
of any such government without the assent of
Congress; nor did I authorize any government agent
or officer to interfere with or exercise any influence or
control over the election of delegates, or over any
convention, in making or modifying their domestic
institutions, or any of the provisions of their proposed
Constitution. On the contrary, the instructions given
by my orders were, that all measures of domestic
policy adopted by the people of California must
originate solely with themselves; that while the Executive
of the United States was desirous to protect
them in the formation of any government republican
in its character, to be at the proper time, submitted
to Congress, yet it was to be distinctly understood
that the plan of such a government must, at the same
time, be the result of their own deliberate choice, and
originate with themselves, without the interference of
the Executive.</p>

<p>I am unable to give any information as to laws
passed by any supposed government in California, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span>
of any census taken in either of the Territories mentioned
in the resolution, as I have no information on
those subjects.</p>

<p>As already stated, I have not disturbed the arrangements
which I found had existed under my
predecessor.</p>

<p>In advising an early application by the people of
these Territories for admission as States, I was actuated
principally by an earnest desire to afford to the
wisdom and patriotism of Congress the opportunity
of avoiding occasions of bitter and angry dissensions
among the people of the United States.</p>

<p>Under the Constitution, every State has the right
of establishing, and, from time to time, altering its
municipal laws and domestic institutions, independently
of every other State and of the general government;
subject only to the prohibitions and guaranties
expressly set forth in the Constitution of the United
States. The subjects thus left exclusively to the
respective States were not designed or expected to
become topics of national agitation. Still, as, under
the Constitution, Congress has power to make all
needful rules and regulations respecting the Territories
of the United States, every new acquisition of territory
has led to discussions on the question whether
the system of involuntary servitude which prevails in
many of the States should or should not be prohibited
in that Territory. The periods of excitement from
this cause which have heretofore occurred have been
safely passed; but during the interval, of whatever
length, which may elapse before the admission of the
Territories ceded by Mexico as States, it appears
probable that similar excitement will prevail to an
undue extent.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span></p>

<p>Under these circumstances, I thought, and still
think, that it was my duty to endeavor to put it in
the power of Congress, by the admission of California
and New Mexico as States, to remove all occasion for
the unnecessary agitation of the public mind.</p>

<p>It is understood that the people of the western part
of California have formed a plan of a State Constitution,
and will soon submit the same to the judgment
of Congress, and apply for admission as a State.
This course on their part, though in accordance with,
was not adopted exclusively in consequence of,
any expression of my wishes inasmuch as measures
tending to this end had been promoted by the officers
sent there by my predecessor, and were already in
active progress of execution before any communication
from me reached California. If the proposed
Constitution shall, when submitted to Congress, be
found to be in compliance with the requisitions of the
Constitution of the United States, I earnestly recommend
that it may receive the sanction of Congress.</p>

<p>The part of California not included in the proposed
State of that name is believed to be uninhabited, except
in a settlement of our countrymen in the vicinity
of Salt Lake.</p>

<p>A claim has been advanced by the State of Texas
to a very large portion of the most populous district
of New Mexico. If the people of New Mexico had
formed a plan of a State government for that Territory
as ceded by the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo,
and had been admitted by Congress as a State, our
Constitution would have afforded the means of obtaining
an adjustment of the question of boundary with
Texas by a judicial decision. At present, however,
no judicial tribunal has the power of deciding that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>
question, and it remains for Congress to devise some
mode for its adjustment. Meanwhile, I submit to Congress
the question whether it would be expedient,
before such adjustment, to establish a territorial
government, which, by including the district so
claimed, would practically decide the question adversely
to the State of Texas or, by excluding it,
would decide it in her favor. In my opinion, such a
course would not be expedient, especially as the people
of this Territory still enjoy the benefit and protection
of their municipal laws, originally derived
from Mexico, and have a military force stationed
there to protect them against the Indians. It is undoubtedly
true that the property, lives, liberties, and
religion of the people of New Mexico are better protected
than they ever were before the treaty of cession.</p>

<p>Should Congress, when California shall present herself
for incorporation into the Union, annex a condition
to her admission as a State affecting her domestic
institutions, contrary to the wishes of her people,
and even compel her temporarily, to comply with it,
yet the State, could change her Constitution at any
time after admission, when to her it should seem
expedient. Any attempt to deny to the people of the
State the right of self-government, in a matter which
peculiarly affects themselves, will infallibly be regarded
by them as an invasion of their rights; and,
upon the principles laid down in our own Declaration
of Independence, they will certainly be sustained by
the great mass of the American people. To assert
that they are a conquered people, and must, as a
State, submit to the will of their conquerors in this
regard, will meet with no cordial response among
American freemen. Great numbers of them are native
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span>
citizens of the United States not inferior to the
rest of our countrymen in intelligence and patriotism;
and no language of menace, to restrain them in the
exercise of an undoubted right, guarantied to them
by the treaty of cession itself, shall ever be uttered
by me, or encouraged and sustained by persons acting
under my authority. It is to be expected that, in the
residue of the Territory ceded to us by Mexico, the
people residing there will, at the time of their incorporation
into the Union as a State, settle all questions
of domestic policy to suit themselves. No material
inconvenience will result from the want, for a short
period, of a government established by Congress over
that part of the Territory which lies eastward of the
new State of California; and the reasons for my
opinion that New Mexico will, at no very distant period,
ask for admission into the Union, are founded on
un-official information, which, I suppose, is common to
all who have cared to make inquiries on that subject.</p>

<p>Seeing, then, that the question which now excites
such painful sensations in the country will, in the end,
certainly be settled by the silent effect of causes independent
of the action of Congress, I again submit to
your wisdom the policy recommended in my annual
message, of awaiting the salutary operation of those
causes, believing that we shall thus avoid the creation
of geographical parties, and secure the harmony of
feeling so necessary to the beneficial action of our
political system. Connected as the Union is with the
remembrance of past happiness, the sense of present
blessings, and the hope of future peace and prosperity,
every dictate of wisdom, every feeling of duty, and
every emotion of patriotism, tend to inspire fidelity
and devotion to it, and admonish us cautiously to avoid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span>
any unnecessary controversy which can either endanger
it or impair its strength, the chief element of
which is to be found in the regard and affection of the
people for each other.</p>

<p class="left65"><i>Monterey, August 30, 1849</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">General</span>:&mdash;I have the honor to transmit, herewith,
copies of civil papers and letters issued by me since
my despatch of June 30, and to continue my report
on the civil affairs of this country from this date.</p>

<p>Accompanied by Captain Halleck, Secretary of
State for California, and Major Canby, Captain Wescott,
and Lieutenant Derby, of my military staff, I
left this place on the 5th July for the purpose of inspecting
the military posts in the interior, and of
learning from personal observation the actual state
of affairs in the mineral regions, and also of allaying,
so far as I could, the hostile feeling which was said to
exist between the Americans and foreigners who were
working in the gold placers. My report on the state
of the troops and a more detailed account of my tour
will be forwarded with my military papers.</p>

<p>Passing the mission of San Juan Bautista, we
crossed the coast range of mountains near the ranche
of Senor Pacheco, and struck the San Joaquin River
near the mouth of the Merced; and, after visiting
Major Miller's camp on the Stanislaus, we proceeded
to examine the principal placers on the tributaries of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span>
that river and of the Tuolumne. These washings or
diggings have been among the richest and most productive
in California.</p>

<p>They are situated within a circuit of some twelve
or fifteen miles, and are known as Jamestown, Wood's
Creek, Sonoranian Camp, Sullivan's Creek, Curtis's
Creek, French Creek, Carson's Creek, and Angelo
Creek. Some of these have become places of considerable
business, particularly the Sonoranian Camp,
which presents the appearance of a city of canvas houses.</p>

<p>Passing the Stanislaus River in the mountains, we
proceeded to Major Kingsbury's camp near the mouth
of the American River, crossing in our route the
Calaveras, Moquelume, Seco, and Cosumnes Rivers;
all of which have rich washings near their sources,
and on their bars and islands. From Major Kingsbury's
camp we ascended the American River to Cullamo
Hills, where the first placer was discovered by
Captain Sutter's employees in the spring of 1848.
From Cullamo we crossed the country to Stockton, a
new town on an estero some distance above the mouth
of the San Joaquin, and thence proceeded to Colonel
Cazey's camp at the straits of Carquinnes; returning
via San Francisco to Monterey, which place we
reached on the afternoon of the 9th instant.</p>

<p>We found the country at this season dry and
parched by the sun, the heat of which became very
great the moment we crossed the coast range of mountains.
The thermometer ranges as high as 113° Fah.
in the shade, and above 140° Fah. in the sun. A
great portion of the valley of the Joaquin is so barren
as scarcely to afford subsistence for our animals, and
can never be of much value for agricultural purposes.
There, however, is, some excellent land on the east
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span>
side of that river, bordering its large tributaries. A
considerable portion of the valleys of the Moquelume,
Seco, Cosumnes, and American Rivers is also well
adapted to agriculture; and the broad plains lying
between them furnish abundant pasture for raising
stock. But the amount of good arable land, as compared
with the extent of country which we passed
over, is small, and I am inclined to believe that the
richness and extreme fertility of certain localities
have led to erroneous conclusions respecting the
general character of the country. Certain it is, that
while there may be found sufficient arable lands to
support, if well cultivated, a numerous population,
here is also a very great extent of rough and mountainous
country and sandy and barren plains which
are of little value. The great difficulty to be encountered
in agricultural pursuits in some portions of
California is the want of water for irrigation; but
possibly this difficulty may be overcome in part by
resorting to artesian wells. If so, much of the public
land which is now unsaleable may be brought into
market, and the settlement of the country greatly accelerated.
I would, therefore, suggest whether it
may not be advisable for our government to direct
some experiments to be made at the public expense in
sinking wells of this character, for even if unsuccessful
as a means of irrigation, their construction will
greatly assist in determining the geological character
of the country. At present nearly all agricultural
labors are suspended in the general scramble for gold;
but the enormous prices paid for fruit and vegetables
in the towns will undoubtedly induce many, during
the coming year, to turn their attention to the cultivation
of the soil. The failure on the part of Congress,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a></span>
at its last session, to authorize the sale of public lands
in California, has proved detrimental to the agricultural
interest of the country.</p>

<p>A large number of those who have recently emigrated
to California are desirous to locate themselves
permanently in the country, and to cultivate the soil,
but the uncertainty which exists with respect to the
validity of land titles in California, and to what actually
constitutes the public domain, serves as a serious
check to the forming of new agricultural settlements;
moreover, speculators are purchasing up fraudulent
and invalid titles to large tracts of the public domain,
and selling them off in parcels, and at enormous profits,
to those who have recently arrived in the country, and
who are necessarily ignorant of the real state of the
case. All the mission lands in California were secularized,
or made government property, by a law of
Mexico, dated August 17th, 1833, and the territorial
government of California, under the authority of the
Mexican laws, leased and sold a portion of these lands
and mission property. Another portion of this property,
however, still remained unsold when the Americans
took possession of the country, and it has since
been left in the hands of government agents for preservation.
Erroneously supposing that these lands are
subject to pre-emption laws, some of the recent emigrants
have attempted to settle upon them.</p>

<p>But I cannot deem myself justifiable in permitting
this, for I do not conceive that lands which have been
under cultivation for half a century, and now belong
to government, can be subject to the pre-emption
claims of private individuals, in the same manner as
the uncultivated lands of the public domain. It is,
however, important for the interest of the country that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span>
these mission lands be brought into market with the
least possible delay, and also that provision be made
by law for the settlement and sale of other public lands
in California. And as disputes are almost daily occurring
between individuals respecting the extent of
their several claims, and the validity of their titles, I
would urge upon our government the necessity of
immediately taking measures for the speedy and final
settlement of these titles upon principles of equity and
justice. This is absolutely essential for the peace
and prosperity of the country.</p>

<p>For information connected with this subject, I beg
leave to call attention, to the report of Captain Halleck,
Secretary of State for California, which was
forwarded to Washington by my predecessor, in the
early part of April last.</p>

<p>Before leaving Monterey I heard numerous rumors
of irregularities and crimes among those working in
the <i>placers</i>; but, on visiting the mining regions, I
was agreeably surprised to learn that every thing was
quite the reverse from what had been represented,
and that order and regularity were preserved throughout
almost the entire extent of the mineral districts.
In each little settlement, or tented town, the miners
have elected their local alcaldes and constables, whose
judicial decisions and official acts are sustained by the
people, and enforced with much regularity and energy.
It is true, that in a few instances certain local questions
have produced temporary excitements and difficulties,
but none of these have been of a very important
character, or led to serious results. Alcaldes have
probably in some cases, and under peculiar circumstances,
exercised judicial powers which were never
conferred upon them by law; but the general result
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a></span>
has been favorable to the preservation of order and
the dispensation of justice.</p>

<p>The old <i>placers</i> are still exceedingly productive, and
new ones are almost daily discovered in the smaller
streams running from the western slope of the Sierra
Nevada into the great valleys of the Sacramento and
San Joaquin Rivers.</p>

<p>I am satisfied, however, from personal observation,
that very exaggerated accounts have been sent to
the United States respecting the ease with which the
precious metal is extracted from the earth, and that
many who come to this country with the expectation
of acquiring sudden wealth, with little or no labor, will
be sadly disappointed. It is true that the reward of
labor in the mines is very high; but it should not be
forgotten that gold <i>digging</i> and gold washing in that
climate require strong constitutions and great physical
exertions, and very few need expect to acquire fortunes
by working the <i>placers</i>, without severe labor
and fixed habits of industry and temperance. The
yield of different localities is, of course, very different,
some of the <i>placers</i> being exceedingly rich, while the
product of others is scarcely sufficient to pay the
expenses of working. But I think the general averages
per diem, for those actually employed in washing for
gold, will not vary much from an ounce or an ounce
and a half per man; some make much more than that
sum, while those who are less fortunate fall much short
of it. The actual number of persons working the
<i>placers</i> will not vary much from ten thousand. The
entire population now in the mining district is much
greater than that number; but many are engaged in
mercantile pursuits and in transporting goods and
provisions, while others employ much of their time in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">353</a></span>
"prospecting," or looking for newer and richer localities.</p>

<p>I also found that the reports which had reached me
of hostilities between Americans and foreigners, in
the mining districts, were greatly exaggerated, and
that, with a few individual exceptions, every thing had
remained quiet and orderly. In some of the northern
<i>placers</i> a party of Americans and Europeans, urged
on by political aspirants, who seem willing to endanger
the peace and tranquillity of the country, in order to
promote their own personal interest, have assumed the
authority to order all Mexicans and South Americans
from that part of the territory. Their orders were
quietly submitted to by the foreigners, a portion of
whom removed to the mines further south, where the
American population manifested a very decided disposition
to afford them protection should they be further
molested. The more intelligent and thinking portion
of Americans regard this measure as illegal and injudicious,
and will discountenance any repetition of
movements so well calculated to disturb the public
tranquillity, and to create bitter and exasperated feelings,
where it is evidently our policy to cultivate those
of the most friendly character. Some of the English,
Irish, and German emigrants, in the northern <i>placers</i>,
assisted in this movement against the Mexicans, Peruvians,
and Chilians, and probably exerted themselves
much more than any of our own citizens to create a
prejudice and excitement against the Spanish race.
They were probably actuated by pecuniary interest.
The great influx of people from the southern portion
of this continent was diminishing the price of labor in
the towns near the northern rivers, and the large
number of pack animals brought from Lower California
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">354</a></span>
and Sonora was producing a corresponding reduction
in the expenses of transportation.</p>

<p>For example, the price of a pack mule in some
parts of the mining districts a few months ago was
about $500, whereas they can now be purchased for
less than $150. The cost of transportation from the
principal landing on the San Joaquin River to the
Sonoranian camp was $75 per hundred, whereas at the
present time it is only about $7.</p>

<p>This has reduced the prices of provisions in the
<i>placers</i> one and two hundred per cent. Some of the
merchants who had large stocks of goods in the mines,
and those who were engaged in transportation at the
prices formerly paid, have suffered by the change,
and it is natural that they should feel incensed against
that class of foreigners who have contributed most to
effect it.</p>

<p>But it is thought by others that the great majority
of the laborers and consumers in the mining districts
have been benefited by this change, and that it would
be injurious to the prosperity of the country to restore
things to their former state by the expulsion and prohibition
of foreigners from the mines.</p>

<p>Americans, by their superior intelligence and
shrewdness in business, generally contrive to turn to
their own benefit the earnings of the Mexicans,
Chilians, and Peruvians in this country, and any
measure of exclusiveness which is calculated to diminish
the productive labor of California would be of exceedingly
doubtful policy.</p>

<p>When applied to by the different parties for my
opinion on the question of expelling foreigners, I have
uniformly told them that no persons, native Americans
or foreigners, have any legal right to dig gold in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">355</a></span>
public lands; but that, until the government of the
United States should act in the matter, they would
not be molested in their pursuits; that I could not
countenance any class of men in their attempts to
monopolize the working of the mines, and that all
questions touching the temporary right of individuals
to work in particular localities, of which they were in
actual possession, should be left to the decision of the
local judicial authorities.</p>

<p>I cannot close my remarks on this subject without
again calling the attention of government to the
importance of establishing a mint in California at the
earliest moment.</p>

<p>This measure is called for by every consideration
of natural policy and of justice to the mercantile
mining population of California.</p>

<p>General Kearny, during his administration of affairs
in this country, appointed, by virtue of his authority
as governor of California, two sub-Indian agents, who
have ever since been continued in office, and their
services found of great utility in preserving harmony
among the wild tribes, and in regulating their intercourse
with the whites.</p>

<p>They have been paid from the "civil fund" very
moderate salaries, which will be continued until arrivals
of agents regularly appointed by the general
government. Notwithstanding every effort on the
part of those agents and of the officers of the army
here, it has not been possible at all times to prevent
aggression on the part of the whites, or to restrain
the Indians from avenging these injuries in their own
way.</p>

<p>In the month of April last, the agent in the Sacramento
valley reported that a body of Oregonians and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">356</a></span>
mountaineers had committed most horrible barbarities
on the defenceless Indians in that vicinity.</p>

<p>Those cruel and inhuman proceedings, added, perhaps,
to the execution of a number of chiefs some year
and a half since by a military force sent into the San
Joaquin valley by my predecessor, (the facts of which
were reported to Washington at the time,) have necessarily
produced a hostile feeling on the part of the
natives, and several small parties of whites, who, in
their pursuit of gold, ventured too far into the Indian
country, have been killed.</p>

<p>My correspondence with the Indian agents and
military officers established in the Sacramento and
San Joaquin valleys will inform you of the measures
taken to prevent a repetition of these difficulties.</p>

<p>I would respectfully recommend that at least three
sub-Indian agents be appointed for this country, and
stationed in the valleys of the Sacramento and San
Joaquin.</p>

<p>These agents should receive ample pay in order to
enable them to defray the expenses of living in that
part of the country, and should be men of the highest
moral character; for otherwise they would not resist
the temptation to engage in illicit trade with the
natives, or to employ them for the individual benefit
of the agents in washing for gold.</p>

<p>The election called by me for the 1st instant was
held on that day, and has been attended with the
most happy results.</p>

<p>Every district has elected its local officers, and
appointed delegates to meet in general convention at
this place on the 1st proximo, to form a State Constitution
or plan of territorial government, which will
be submitted to the people for their ratification, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">357</a></span>
transmitted to Washington for the action of Congress.</p>

<p>Most of the local and judicial officers named in my
proclamation of the 3d of June, have already entered
upon their duties, and the interest which was taken
by the people in every part of the country in this
election, and the zeal manifested by those elected and
appointed to office, afford strong hopes that the existing
government will be able to preserve order and
secure the administration of justice until a new one
shall be put into regular and successful operation.</p>

<p>In my former despatch I mentioned that the civil
officers of the existing government would be paid their
regular salaries from the "civil funds," which had
been formed, under the direction of the governor of
California, mainly out of the proceeds of the temporary
custom-houses established by my predecessors on this
coast.</p>

<p>It will also be necessary to use a portion of this
fund in the immediate construction of jails for the
security of civil prisoners.</p>

<p>The want of such jails has already led to the most
serious inconveniencies; prisoners have so frequently
effected their escape, that, on several occasions, the
people have risen in masses and executed criminals
immediately after trial, and without waiting for the
due fulfilment of all the requisitions of the laws.</p>

<p>In many cases it has been found necessary to confine
civil prisoners on board vessels of war, and in the
guard-houses of the garrison; but in towns, at a distance
from the coast and the military posts, the difficulty
of retaining prisoners in custody has led, in some
instances, to immediate and summary executions.</p>

<p>This evil calls for an immediate remedy, which will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">358</a></span>
be afforded, so far as the means at my disposal will
admit.</p>

<p>I beg leave, in this place, to add a few remarks on
the use which has been, and will continue to be, made
of this "civil fund."</p>

<p>In the instructions from Washington to General
Kearny, in 1846, for his guidance in California, the
establishment of port regulations on this coast was
assigned to the commander of the <i>Pacific squadron</i>,
while it was said "the appointment of temporary collectors
at the several ports appertains to the civil
governor of the province."</p>

<p>It was also directed that the duties at the custom-houses
be used for the support of the necessary
officers of the civil government. This division of
duties, and this disposition of the proceeds of the
customs were continued during the whole war.</p>

<p>On the receipt of the Treasury Department regulations
respecting the collection of military contributions
in Mexico, officers of the army and navy
were made collectors at some of the ports, but at
others the civil collectors appointed by the Governor
of California were retained.</p>

<p>At the close of the war, Governor Mason, for reasons
already communicated, determined to continue
the collection of revenue in the country, on the authority
which had previously been given to him, until
Congress should act in the matter, or orders to the
contrary be received from Washington. He, therefore,
as governor of California, again appointed civil
collectors in the ports where military officers had temporarily
performed those duties, and collected the
customs on all foreign goods, in accordance with the
provisions of the tariff of 1846, while the commander
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">359</a></span>
of the Pacific squadron continued the direction of
all matters relating to port regulations. A double
necessity impelled the governor to this course. The
country was in pressing need of these foreign goods,
and Congress had established no port of entry on this
coast. The want of a more complete organization of
the existing civil government was daily increasing, and,
as Congress had made no provisions for supporting a
government in this country, it was absolutely necessary
to create a fund for that purpose from the duties collected
on these foreign goods. It is true that there
were no laws authorizing the collection of these
duties; but at the same time the laws forbade the
landing of the goods till the duties <i>were</i> paid. Governor
Mason, therefore, had no alternative but to
pursue the course which he adopted. He immediately
communicated to Washington his action in the case;
and as the receipt of his despatch was acknowledged
without any dissent being expressed, it must be presumed
that his course met the approbation of the
government. When I assumed command in this
country as civil governor, I was directed to receive
these communications and instructions from Governor
Mason, for my guidance in the administration of the
civil affairs of this Territory. I have accordingly
continued the collection of the revenue, and added
the proceeds to the "civil fund," using that fund for
the necessary expenses of the civil government. The
expenses of employing civil officers in this country
are very great; and as I have no authority to lay
taxes, this fund forms my only means of carrying on
the government. The necessity of employing these
officers, and of paying them the full salaries authorized
by law under the existing state of affairs, is too obvious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">360</a></span>
to require comment. I have pledged myself to
pay these salaries from the "civil fund," unless forbidden
to do so by direct orders from Washington;
and that pledge will be fulfilled. This "civil fund"
was commenced in the early part of 1847, and has
been formed and used in the manner pointed out in
the early instructions to the governor of the Territory.
This money has been collected and disbursed
by the "Governor of California" and by those appointed
by him in virtue of his office. He is, therefore,
the person responsible for this money, both to
the government and to the parties from whom it is
collected, and it can be expended only on his orders.
None of the military departments of the army, nor
any army officer simply in virtue of his commission,
can have any control, direct or indirect, over it. It is
true that some of this money has, from time to time, as
the wants of the service required, been transferred to
the different military departments; but this transfer
was in the form of a <i>loan</i>, and the money so transferred
will be returned to the "civil fund" as soon as
arrangements can be made for that purpose. The increased
expenditures for the support of the existing
government will soon render the restoration absolutely
necessary; especially as the transfer of the custom-houses
to the regular collectors appointed by the
general government, will now cut off all further means
of supplying the civil treasury. These collectors have
not yet arrived, but are daily expected.</p>

<p class="p2">The following official despatch of General Persifor
F. Smith, contains an opinion of the position of San
Francisco totally different from that of the numerous
California tourists. It is a valuable opinion, nevertheless,
and led to the selection of the town of Benicia,
on the Straits of Karquinez, as a military and naval
station.</p>

<p class="left45">
<span class="smcap">Headquarters Third Division</span>,<br />
<span class="i2"><i>San Francisco, April 5, 1849</i>.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">General</span>:&mdash;Since my last communication no troops
have arrived to change the strength of the force here;
but the steam transport Edith arrived on the 21st of
March, and reports that the transports Iowa and
Massachusetts, the former having General Riley with
a part of the 2d infantry, and the latter having the
command of artillery for Oregon on board, left Valparaiso
about the 8th of February. The former is
expected here every day, and the Edith is held in
readiness to convey the troops south to the position
they are to occupy.</p>

<p>There will be great difficulty in establishing and
maintaining a post at the mouth of the Gila,
until more knowledge is acquired of the navigation
of the head of the gulf of California and the
lower part of the Colorado. Transportation by land
from San Diego is impossible for large quantities
of stores.</p>

<p>In the gulf, the winds blow in the winter almost
invariably from the northward; and in the summer,
when they come occasionally from southward, it
is in violent gales, with severe squalls and thunder,
rendering it very dangerous to be in the
gulf then. In other words, it is always difficult to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">362</a></span>
run up the gulf, but almost always easy to run south.
These circumstances render the employment of steam
vessels very advantageous. If the navigation of the
gulf permits the Edith to be used she will answer,
having both sails and steam. If she draws too much
water, others of lighter draught could be procured.
I mention this now, as the boundary commission will
commence their labors on this end of the line, and
will be on the Gila next season. I should have observed
that the Colorado is supposed to be navigable
only for boats drawing three or four feet.</p>

<p>I see no reason for posting troops on any other
point out of reach of the ports on the Pacific. The
Indians in the interior do not make it necessary, and
it would be useless to place them near the mines to
maintain order there. Nothing but the establishment
of a regular civil government, to be carried on by
those most interested in the existence of good order,
will answer that end.</p>

<p>Such detachments as go to the southern part of the
Territory will accordingly be placed, as heretofore
mentioned, in healthy and convenient positions, and
those on this bay at such points as will combine good
climate, convenience of supply, and facility of movement.
I propose, when such a point is found, to have
removed all the public stores there, both from this
place and Monterey, leaving the heavy ordnance and
stores.</p>

<p>The town of San Francisco is no way fitted for
military or commercial purposes; there is no harbor,
a bad landing-place, bad water, no supplies of provisions,
an inclement climate, and it is cut off from
the rest of the country, except by a long circuit
around the southern extremity of the bay. In time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">363</a></span>
of war, enemies' troops could be landed for many
miles south of the entrance of the bay on the sea
beach, and thus cut it off by a short line across the
peninsula on which it stands. There are points on
the bay, more inland, having good harbors and landings,
good water, and open to the whole country in
rear, and accessible without difficulty to ships of the
largest class. One of these should be the point at
which the future depots should be established; and I
propose to go to-morrow in the Edith, in company with
Commodore Jones and other officers of the army and
navy, to examine the straits of Karquinez, said to
combine most advantages. I hope to return and
report the result of our examination before the next
mail boat leaves, (on Monday, 9th,) but at any rate
by the succeeding boat, a few days afterwards.</p>

<p>I hope that in fixing the port of entry, capital, or
other public places, the law will leave to the President
the selection; otherwise, private interests already
involved in speculation here, will, by misrepresentation,
lead to a very bad choice.</p>

<p>If Congress has not provided by law for the government
of this Territory, or its admission as a State, I
would be very glad that the government would officially
promulgate its views as to the civil authority now
exercised here. Some important questions of law,
involving both life and property, are now depending;
and judges and jurors, without experience in these
difficult questions, are called upon to act under great
responsibility.</p>

<p>It appears to be the opinion of merchants in many
of the ports of the Pacific&mdash;and they allege in support
of it the advice of some of our consuls&mdash;that in
virtue of the circular of the Secretary of the Treasury
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">364</a></span>
of October 30, as the Treasury Department could not
collect duties on imports in California, their goods,
though dutiable, could be imported without paying
duty. I have held that this was not the construction
proper to be given to the circular, but only that the
law had not provided the means of collecting duties
here, that law being still in force which prohibits certain
goods being introduced into the United States,
unless they pay duties as prescribed; that consequently
no dutiable goods can be landed in California
unless they shall have paid their duties elsewhere&mdash;the
effect of which would be, that they could not be admitted
at all from foreign ports.</p>

<p>Under the circumstances, which showed a very hard
case, I thought it proper that the parties should be
allowed to deposit the amount of duties and land the
goods; but, lest this should be construed as giving
them a right for the future, and as the president may
think proper to put an end to this indulgence, I have
addressed a circular to all our consuls on these seas,
warning them of this possibility&mdash;a copy of which is
inclosed.</p>

<p>I was directed, when coming here, by the Secretary
of War, to do all I could to facilitate the arrival of
the civil officers of government in Oregon, as the
public service required their presence there. The
steamer in which we came here could go no farther
north, and there was no possible way of those gentlemen
getting there, except on a small vessel about sailing,
on which there were no accommodations.</p>

<p>Commodore Jones kindly sent carpenters from the
fleet to put up some berths, and on General Adair's
(the collector's) representation, that no bedding could
be procured, I directed the quartermaster to issue him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">365</a></span>
the necessary number of blankets for the voyage, and
take his receipt for them. I respectfully ask that
this may be approved, and the amount charged to
General Adair. The quartermaster could not tell him
the price of the blankets when he took them.</p>

<p>As the rainy season has ended, people are again
repairing to the mines. New discoveries farther
south are said to have been made; and it is now
pretty certain that the whole slope of the Sierra Nevada,
comprised within the head waters of the San
Joaquin to the south and those of the Sacramento to
the north, contains gold. These two rivers, forming,
as it were, a bracket, join to enter the bay of San
Francisco; and their tributaries from the east, in
their beds, expose the deposits of gold as they descend
from the mountains. It is on the banks and branches
of these streams that adventurers are now at work;
but some excavations elsewhere, to a depth equal to
that worn by the creeks, have disclosed quantities similar
to those most generally found. There appears to
be a line parallel to the summit of the main ridge,
and some distance down the slope, at which the product
of gold is at its maximum; but whether this be
from the quantity deposited, or from the different
position as relates to the surface, or from the difficulty
of working it, I have not the means of knowing.</p>

<p>The gold is found in small particles: the largest I have
seen, but such are rare, weighs seventy-one ounces troy.
The appearance invariably is as though it had been
spurted up when melted through crevices and fissures
in drops, which have often the form of the leaves and
gravel on which they have fallen. I speak of this
as an appearance, not as a theory or hypothesis. The
extent ascertained within which gold is thus found is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">366</a></span>
at least four hundred miles long by forty wide; in almost
every part of which, where the surface is depressed
by the beds of rivers, gold has been obtained
without digging more than ten feet below the surface,
and very seldom that much.</p>

<p>It is impossible to furnish any grounds for estimating
the number of people engaged in mining, or the
amount they have produced. Persons engaged in
trading with the miners say they amount to about ten
thousand, but I cannot say with what reason. They
can better judge of the amount produced, which the
lowest estimate places at $4,000,000. More than
three thousand persons have been added to the miners
up to this time,&mdash;chiefly from Mexico and South
America.</p>

<p>When the mines were first discovered, all the ports
of South America on the Pacific, and of the Sandwich
islands, sent the merchandise collected and stored
there to be sold here. They realized enormous profits,
before any competition from our eastern States could
meet them; and these goods were generally owned by
European houses, who thus became possessed of the
first fruits of the mines, which were shipped to Europe
on their account; and it is thus that so little
gold has reached the United States.</p>

<p>When the merchandise now on its way from our Atlantic
States arrives, and is sold, the current will set
that way; but the profits will be much diminished by
competition, and still more by the enormous expenses
here for labor, storage, &amp;c. These are almost incredible;
the ordinary wages for the poorest laborer is $6
per day; many receive $10.</p>

<p>The extent and richness of the gold region have
not been exaggerated; and the exorbitant prices paid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">367</a></span>
for labor, rent, and subsistence, have hardly been
fully set forth. But all the estimates of the amount
actually produced are but mere suppositions, which
may surpass or may fall short of the truth.</p>

<p>I have already directed that the men to whom their
commanding officers may give short leaves of absence
may be employed by the quartermasters at the usual
rates here. This will be an encouragement to the
men and an advantage to the public service, as labor
is hard to get. But I doubt the propriety of yielding
to the current of gold-seeking, and allowing large
bodies of the men to go to the mines. It may be
permitted to reward good conduct, as any other indulgence
is; but to make it general, would be either to
acknowledge the right of the men to modify their
obligations as they please, or to confess our inability
to enforce their fulfilment. For the sake of principle
and preciseness, it would be better to adhere to what
is right now, though the effect here in this particular
instance would be the desertion of the men.</p>

<p class="left45"><i>Washington, June 3, 1846</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: I herewith send you a copy of my letter to
the governor of Missouri for an additional force of
one thousand mounted men.</p>

<p>The object of thus adding to the force under your
command is not, as you will perceive, fully set forth
in that letter, for the reason that it is deemed prudent
that it should not, at this time, become a matter of
public notoriety; but to you it is proper and necessary
that it should be stated.</p>

<p>It has been decided by the President to be of the
greatest importance in the pending war with Mexico
to take the earliest possession of Upper California.
An expedition with that view is hereby ordered, and
you are designated to command it. To enable you to
be in sufficient force to conduct it successfully, this
additional force of a thousand mounted men has been
provided, to follow you in the direction of Santa Fe,
to be under your orders or the officer you may leave
in command at Santa Fe.</p>

<p>It cannot be determined how far this additional
force will be behind that designed for the Santa Fe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">369</a></span>
expedition, but it will not probably be more than a
few weeks. When you arrive at Santa Fe with the
force already called, and shall have taken possession
of it, you may find yourselves in a condition to garrison
it with a small part of your command (as the
additional force will soon be at that place), and with
the remainder press forward to California. In that
case you will make such arrangements as to being
followed by the reinforcement before mentioned, as in
your judgment may be deemed safe and prudent. I
need not say to you that in case you conquer Santa
Fe, (and with it will be included the department or
state of New Mexico), it will be important to provide
for retaining safe possession of it. Should you deem
it prudent to have still more troops for the accomplishment
of the objects herein designated, you will
lose no time in communicating your opinion on that
point, and all others connected with the enterprise, to
this department. Indeed, you are hereby authorized
to make a direct requisition for it upon the governor
of Missouri.</p>

<p>It is known that a large body of Mormon emigrants
are <i>en route</i> to California for the purpose of settling
in that country. You are desired to use all proper
means to have a good understanding with them, to
the end that the United States may have their co-operation
in taking possession of and holding that
country. It has been suggested here that many of
these Mormons would willingly enter into the service
of the United States, and aid us in our expedition
against California. You are hereby authorized to
muster into service such as can be induced to volunteer;
not, however, to a number exceeding one-third
of your entire force. Should they enter the service
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">370</a></span>
they will be paid as other volunteers, and you can allow
them to designate, so far as it can be properly done,
the persons to act as officers thereof. It is understood
that a considerable number of American citizens
are now settled on the Sacramento River, near <i>Sutter's</i>
establishment, called "Nueva Helvetia," who are
well disposed towards the United States. Should
you, on your arrival in the country, find this to be
the true state of things there, you are authorized to
organize and receive into the service of the United
States such portion of these citizens as you may think
useful to aid you to hold the possession of the country.
You will in that case allow them, so far as
you shall judge proper, to select their own officers.
A large discretionary power is invested in
you in regard to these matters, as well as to all
others, in relation to the expeditions confided to your
command.</p>

<p>The choice of routes by which you will enter California
will be left to your better knowledge and
ampler means of getting accurate information. We
are assured that a southern route (called the caravan
route, by which the wild horses are brought from that
country into New Mexico) is practicable, and it is
suggested as not improbable that it can be passed
over in the winter months, or at least late in autumn.
It is hoped that this information may prove to be
correct.</p>

<p class="caption">GAMBLING SCENE AT SAN FRANCISCO.</p>
</div>

<p>In regard to the routes, the practicability of procuring
needful supplies for men and animals, and
transporting baggage, is a point to be well considered.
Should the President be disappointed in his cherished
hope that you will be able to reach the interior of
Upper California before winter, you are then desired
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">371</a></span>
to make the best arrangement you can for sustaining
your forces during the winter, and for an early movement
in the spring. Though it is very desirable that
the expedition should reach California this season,
(and the President does not doubt you will make
every possible effort to accomplish this object), yet
if, in your judgment, it cannot be undertaken with
a reasonable prospect of success, you will defer
it, as above suggested, until spring. You are left
unembarrassed by any specific directions in this
matter.</p>

<p>It is expected that the naval forces of the United
States which are now, or will soon be in the Pacific,
will be in possession of all the towns on the seacoast,
and will co-operate with you in the conquest of California.
Arms, ordnance, munitions of war, and provisions
to be used in that country, will be sent by
sea to our squadron in the Pacific for the use of the
land forces.</p>

<p>Should you conquer and take possession of New
Mexico and Upper California, or considerable places
in either, you will establish temporary civil governments
therein&mdash;abolishing all arbitrary restrictions
that may exist, so far as it may be done with safety.
In performing this duty, it would be wise and prudent
to continue in their employment all such of the existing
officers as are known to be friendly to the United
States, and will take the oath of allegiance to them.
The duties at the custom-house ought at once to be
reduced to such a rate as may be barely sufficient to
maintain the necessary officers, without yielding any
revenue to the government. You may assure the
people of those provinces, that it is the wish and design
of the United States to provide for them a free
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">372</a></span>
government with the least possible delay, similar to
that which exists in our territories. They will then
be called on to exercise the rights of freemen in
electing their own representatives to the territorial
legislature. It is foreseen that what relates to the
civil government will be a difficult and unpleasant
part of your duty, and much must necessarily be left
to your own discretion. In your whole conduct you
will act in such a manner as best to conciliate the inhabitants
and render them friendly to the United
States.</p>

<p>It is desirable that the usual trade between the
citizens of the United States and the Mexican provinces
should be continued, as far as practicable,
under the changed condition of things between the
two countries. In consequence of extending your
expedition into California, it may be proper that you
should increase your supply for goods to be distributed
as presents to the Indians. The United States superintendent
of Indian affairs at St. Louis will aid you
in procuring these goods. You will be furnished with
a proclamation in the Spanish language, to be issued
by you and circulated among the Mexican people on
your entering into or approaching their country.
You will use your utmost endeavors to have the
pledges and promises therein contained carried out to
the utmost extent.</p>

<p>I am directed by the President to say that the rank
of brevet brigadier-general will be conferred on you
as soon as you commence your movement towards
California, and sent round to you by sea or over the
country, or to the care of the commandant of our
squadron in the Pacific. In that way cannon, arms,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">373</a></span>
ammunition, and supplies for the land forces will be
sent to you.</p>

<h3 class="p2"><span class="smcap">Appendix G.</span></h3>

<p class="p2">The particulars of the conquest of Upper California,
as well as the suppression of the insurrections,
we have already given in substance as they are in the
despatches of General Kearny and Commodore Stockton.
But we have said nothing of the transactions
in the Peninsula, as that afterwards was surrendered
to Mexico. All that is interesting in the conquest of
Lower California, will be found in the following
despatches from the commander of the New York
regiment of volunteers, which with a number of
marines were the only troops employed in that quarter.
We premise, that, after the United States
marines had taken San José, the natives rose, and
they were reduced to the necessity of taking refuge
in an old fort, or <i>cuartel</i>, in the town.</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Barracks, Lower California</span>,</p>
<p class="left45"><i>San Jose, February 20, 1848</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: I continue my report from the 22d ultimo,
from which time my force consisted of twenty-seven
marines and fifteen seamen, of whom five were on the
sick report, besides some twenty volunteers, Californians,
who at least served to swell the numbers. From
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">374</a></span>
that date the enemy were continually in sight of us,
intercepting all communication with the interior, and
driving off all the cattle from the neighborhood. A
party of our men who went out to endeavor to obtain
cattle, were driven in and narrowly escaped being cut
off. We succeeded in obtaining a few cows, however,
which were very necessary to us in the reduced state
of our provisions, as, in addition to our garrison, we
were obliged, in humanity, to sustain some fifty women
and children of the poor, who sought our protection
in the greatest distress. I found it necessary, as
soon as our fresh beef was consumed, to put all hands
on half allowance of salt provisions. We had no
bread. On the 4th of February, the enemy closed
around us more, and commenced firing upon all who
showed themselves at our port-holes, or above the
parapets. On the morning of the 6th the enemy appeared
to be a little scattered, a considerable force
being seen riding about some distance from the town,
and at the same time a strong party of them posted
at the lower end of the street were keeping up an
annoying fire upon us. I judged this a favorable
opportunity to make a sortie upon them, and taking
twenty-five men with me, closed with them and dislodged
them, driving them into the hills without the
loss of a man on our part, and returned to the cuartel.
On the morning of the 7th it was reported to me that
the enemy had broken into the houses on the main
street, and there was some property exposed which
might be secured. I took a party of men and went
down and brought up a number of articles belonging
to the Californians, who were in the cuartel; some
distant firing took place, but no injury was sustained.
On the same day, hearing there were some stores of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">375</a></span>
rice and tobacco in a house some three hundred yards
down the main street, I determined upon an effort to
obtain them, and sallied out with thirty men: these
were immediately fired upon from several different
quarters, and some fighting ensued, resulting in the
death of one of my volunteers&mdash;shot through the
heart. We charged down the end of the street, and
drove the enemy to the cover of a cornfield at the
outside of the town, where they were considerably
reinforced, and recommenced a hot fire; but we were
enabled to save a part of the articles which we were
in search of, though we found that the enemy had anticipated
us in this object, having forced the building
from the rear. On the afternoon of the following
day, Ritchie's schooner, having provisions for us from
La Paz, came in sight and anchored, but a canoe
which was enticed toward the shore by a white flag
displayed by the enemy, was fired upon, and the
schooner immediately got under way.</p>

<p>On the 10th the enemy had entire possession of the
town: they had perforated with port-holes all the adjacent
houses and walls, occupying the church, and,
hoisting their flag on Galindo's house, ninety yards distant,
held a high and commanding position, which exposed
our back yard and the kitchen to a raking fire,
which from this time forth was almost incessant from
all quarters upon us, the least exposure of person creating
a target for fifty simultaneous shots. The enemy
appeared to have some excellent rifles, among other
arms; and some of them proved themselves tolerably
sharp shooters, sending their balls continually through
our port-holes. On the 11th the fire was warm, but
on our part it was rarely that we could get a sight of
them. In the afternoon of this day we had to lament
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">376</a></span>
the death of Passed Midshipman McLanahan, attached
to the United States ship Cyane; a ball striking him
in the right side of the neck, a little below the thyroid
cartilage, lodged in the left shoulder. He died in
about two hours. He was a young officer of great
promise, energetic, of much forethought for his age,
and brave to temerity. All lamented his untimely
fate, and all bear willing testimony to his worth.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 12th, at daylight, we discovered
that the enemy had thrown up a breastwork
upon the sand, about one hundred and fifty yards to
the north-east of the cuartel, and entirely commanding
our watering place. We fired several round shot
at it, with little effect. We succeeded in getting in
being in strong force, and kept a close watch upon us.
Their force was over three hundred, speaking within
bounds. I immediately commenced digging a well in
the rear of Mott's house, which is the lowest ground.
I found that we had to go through rock, and judged
we should have to dig about twenty feet. I thought
it imprudent to blast, as the enemy, suspecting our
intention, would throw every obstacle in our way. The
men worked cheerfully on this and the succeeding
day against all difficulties. Our situation was becoming
now an imminently critical one, having with the
greatest economy but four days' water. On the 14th
we continued digging for water. We found that the
enemy had thrown up a second breastwork more to
the westward, giving them a cross-fire upon our watering
place: there was a continual fire kept up upon the
cuartel during the day. At three o'clock, 30 minutes
P.M., a sail was reported in sight, which proved to be
the United Ship Cyane. She anchored after sundown.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">377</a></span>
It was of course a joyful sight to us to see
friends so near; but I was apprehensive that they
could render us but little assistance, the enemy being
so vastly superior in numbers. The enemy continued
their firing upon us during the night. On the 15th at
day-light, we became aware that the Cyane was landing
men. They soon commenced their advance, which for
a few moments was opposed only by a scattering fire;
then the enemy opened upon them in earnest. They
had concentrated nearly their entire force near San
Vincente. We saw the flash of musketry through all
the hills above the village. There was the odds of
three to one against our friends. Steadily they came
on, giving back the enemy's fire as they advanced.
There was still a party of the enemy occupying the
town, firing upon us. I took thirty men, and sallied
out upon them, drove them from cover, killed one
and wounded several of them, and marched out to
join the Cyane's men, who, with Captain Dupont at
their head, had now drawn quite near to us. There
were small detached parties of the enemy still hovering
about them, and firing at them, but the main body
of the enemy had been broken, and retired to "Las
Animas," distant two miles. The march of the
Cyane's men to our relief, through an enemy so vastly
their superior in numbers, well mounted and possessing
every advantage in knowledge of the ground, was
certainly an intrepid exploit, as creditably performed
as it was skilfully and boldly planned, and reflects
the greatest honor on all concerned. It resulted most
fortunately for us in our harassed situation. They
had but four wounded; this cannot be termed any
thing but the most remarkably good luck, considering
the severe fire that this heroic little band were exposed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">378</a></span>
to. The loss of the enemy we have not positively
ascertained: we hear of thirteen killed, with
certainty, and general report says thirty-five;
wounded not known. Of the total loss of the enemy
in their attack upon the cuartel, I cannot speak with
certainty; we have found several graves, and know
of a number wounded, one of whom we have in the
cuartel a prisoner. I suppose their total loss to be
not far from fifteen killed, and many wounded; I am
sure it could not be less than this. Our own total
loss was three killed and four slightly wounded. After
the death of Passed Midshipman McLanahan, there
remained but one officer to my assistance, Passed
Midshipman George A. Stevens, to whom, for his
coolness and indefatigable zeal at a time when so
much devolved upon him, I am most happy to accord
the highest credit; and at the same time I must
honorably mention the conduct of a volunteer, Eugene
Gillespie, Esq., who, although suffering from illness,
never deserted his post, and was with me in the
sortie of the 7th. The non-commissioned officers and
men went through privation, unceasing watchfulness,
and danger, without a murmur. I cannot express too
highly my satisfaction in their conduct. Captain
Dupont immediately upon his arrival here, becoming
aware of our situation as regards provisions, took measures
for our supply. The day after the battle of San
Vincente he despatched a train, which brought us by
hand (the enemy having driven off all the mules and
horses) a quantity of stores and articles of which we
stood most in need, among the rest, bread, and has since
been unceasing in his exertions for our relief. I cannot
too earnestly express the obligations which we are under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">379</a></span>
for the prompt and efficient assistance which Captain
Dupont, his officers, and crew have rendered us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt
of your letter of March 1, 1848, and to report the
arrival of the army storeship "Isabella" at this place
on the 22d of March, 1848, with Captain Naglee's
company (D) New York volunteers, and one hundred
and fourteen recruits for the detachment of New York
volunteers stationed at this place.</p>

<p>The rescue of the prisoners of war on the 15th ultimo
caused great excitement among the enemy, and tended
very much to disorganize their forces, and the important
arrival of the reinforcements to my command
determined me to take the field as soon as possible;
accordingly, I left this place on the morning of the
26th instant with two hundred and seventeen officers
and men; Lieutenant Halleck, United States engineers,
acting chief of staff, and Passed Midshipman
Duncan, United States navy, temporarily attached to
the mounted portion of Captain Naglee's command.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">380</a></span></p>

<p>The afternoon of the 27th, a party of fifteen men
captured, in San Antonio, Pineda, the commander of
the Mexican forces, with his secretary, Serrano.</p>

<p>The morning of the 29th, having received information
that the enemy had concentrated their forces in
Todos Santos, we pressed on with all speed, fearing
they might evade us, by retreating towards Magdalena
Bay. The morning of the 30th, about ten o'clock,
having received accurate information respecting the
enemy, Captain Naglee with forty-five mounted men
was despatched to intercept the road leading from
Todos Santos to Magdalena Bay, and, if practicable,
to attack the enemy in the rear at the same time our
main body made its attack in front.</p>

<p>The road leading from Todos Santos to La Paz, for
some distance before reaching the first named place,
passes through a dense growth of chaparral, (very
favorable for an ambush), and in this the enemy made
their arrangements to receive us. We left the road
about five miles from Todos Santos and marched along
a ridge of high land on the north side of the river,
having full view of the enemy's operations.</p>

<p>They then took possession of a commanding hill
directly in our route, between three and four miles
from Todos Santos, with their Indians in front. Companies
A and B, under the direction of Lieutenant
Halleck, were deployed as skirmishers in such a manner
as to expose the enemy to a cross-fire. The enemy
opened their fire at long distance, but our force advanced
steadily, reserving their fire until within good
musket range, when it was delivered with great effect,
and the enemy retreated very rapidly, after a short
but sharp engagement. At this time, Captain Naglee
being near Todos Santos, and hearing the firing,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">381</a></span>
attacked the enemy in rear, and after a severe action
completed their dispersion. Our men and horses being
too much fatigued by their long march to pursue
the scattered enemy, we marched on to Todos Santos.</p>

<p>The loss of the enemy in this engagement cannot
be ascertained with any accuracy; we know of ten
killed and eight wounded. Our loss was nothing; one
man and the horse of Acting Lieutenant Scott were
slightly wounded, the enemy, as usual, firing too high.</p>

<p>Our officers and men fully sustained the character
they won on the 16th and 27th of November last.</p>

<p>My warmest thanks are due to Lieutenant Halleck,
for his assistance as chief of staff, and I present him
particularly to the notice of the colonel commanding,
for the able manner in which he led on the attack on
the 30th ultimo.</p>

<p>Captain Naglee also deserves particular notice for
the energetic and successful manner in which he fulfilled
his instructions.</p>

<p>On the 31st ultimo, Captain Naglee, with fifty
mounted men of his company, was ordered to pursue
the enemy in the direction of Magdalena Bay. He
returned to La Paz on the 12th instant, having pursued
the enemy very closely, capturing five prisoners
and some arms.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Halleck started for San José with a
party of mounted men, consisting of one officer and
twenty-five non-commissioned officers and privates, on
the 5th instant, for the purpose of communicating
with Captain Dupont, commanding United States
sloop-of-war Cyane. He returned here on the 11th
instant, having captured ten prisoners on his march,
and taken a number of arms.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">382</a></span></p>

<p>From him I learn that the naval force at San José
have thirty odd prisoners, and among others "Mauricio
Castro," the self-styled political chief of Lower
California. Lieutenant Selden, with a party from the
Cyane, made a most opportune march on Santiago,
where he captured a number of the enemy who had
fled from the field of Todos Santos. Castro, who
commanded the enemy's forces in the action of the
30th, was arrested near Maria Flores by the civil
authorities and delivered up to Lieutenant Selden.</p>

<p>During the stay of our main body at Todos Santos
fourteen prisoners were captured; among them two
sons of the reverend padre Gabriel Gonzales, officers
of the Mexican forces.</p>

<p>We left Todos Santos on the 5th instant, and arrived
at this place on the 7th. The result of this short
campaign has been the complete defeat and dispersion
of the enemy's forces.</p>

<p>We have captured their chief and six officers, and
one hundred and three non-commissioned officers and
privates; and others are daily presenting themselves
to the civil authorities in different parts of the country.</p>

<p>The captured arms have been given to those rancheros
known to be friendly to the interests of the
United States, for their protection.</p>

<p class="p2">The following despatch from Governor Mason, gives
an account of the state of affairs in Upper California,
in October, 1847:</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Headquarters Tenth Military Department</span>,</p>
<p><span class="left45"><i>Monterey, California, October 7, 1847</i>.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: I returned from San Francisco yesterday, and
found here Mr. Toler, with despatches from Washington,
the receipt of which I have the honor to acknowledge.
I am also informed by Commodore Shubrick
that the sloop-of-war Preble is ready to sail for
Panama, with Passed Midshipman Wilson as bearer
of despatches for the United States. I therefore avail
myself of the opportunity to send you my letter of
the 18th of September, with its several packages, and
now have to communicate the result of my visit to
San Francisco.</p>

<p>I found the town flourishing and prosperous, with a
busy, industrious population of Americans, and refer
you to the copies of my military correspondence for the
steps adopted to give them a good town government.
The Bay of San Francisco, you are well aware, is a
spacious, elegant harbor, susceptible of the most perfect
defence; but as yet nothing has been done
towards fortifying it, or even placing any of the heavy
guns in position at the old fort. It is found almost
impossible to get much work out of the volunteers;
and all that I can now expect of the two companies
of Major Hardie's command will be to improve their
quarters at the old presidio. This they are at present
engaged upon, using lumber made at the horse saw-mill,
under direction of the assistant quartermaster,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">384</a></span>
Captain Folsom. All this labor is done by the volunteers,
so that the improvements will be made at very
little expense to the government. The price of lumber
at San Francisco is $50 per M.; but Captain
Folsom says that he has it sawed and delivered, by
the labor of the volunteers and his own machinery, at
about $16. The mill is placed in the timber known as
the Red Woods, near the mission of San Rafael, on
the west and north sides of the bay, where any amount
can be had. If the government design to erect permanent
structures to any extent in this country, it
would be advisable to send out a steam engine, with
all the necessary frames and iron-work to adapt it to
immediate use in connexion with the saw and grist
mills now in possession of the quartermaster's department
here. The site at present selected by Captain
Folsom is well adapted, as easy water communication
is had with the San Joaquin and Sacramento Rivers as
well as the parts of the country south of San Francisco.</p>

<p>At San Francisco I found all the powder, arms,
accoutrements, and perishable ordnance property well
stored in a building prepared for the purpose at the
presidio barracks; but the guns, mortars, carriages,
shot, and shells are in the town in the open air, protected
by paint alone. The great difficulty of hauling
such articles over the rugged hills between the town
and presidio will prevent their being hauled to the
latter place this season.</p>

<p>I did design to continue my tour of inspection to
Sonoma and the Sacramento River, but was recalled
by hearing of the arrival of the bearer of despatches
at Monterey.</p>

<p>When on my way up to San Francisco, I was overtaken
by Captain Brown, of the Mormon battalion,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">385</a></span>
who had arrived from Fort Hall, where he had left
his detachment of the battalion, to come to California
to report to me in person. He brought a muster-roll
of his detachment, with a power of attorney from all
its members to draw their pay; and as the battalion
itself had been discharged on the 16th of July, Paymaster
Rich paid to Captain Brown the money due the
detachment up to that date, according to the rank
they bore upon the muster-rolls upon which the battalion
had been mustered out of service. Captain
Brown started immediately for Fort Hall, at which
place and in the valley of Bear River he said the
whole Mormon emigration intended to pass the winter.
He reported that he had met Captain Hunt, late of
the Mormon battalion, who was on his way to meet
the emigrants and bring into the country this winter,
if possible, a battalion according to the terms offered
in my letter to him of the 16th of August, a copy of
which you will find among the military correspondence
of the department.</p>

<p>In my letter I offered Captain Hunt the command
of the battalion with the rank of lieutenant-colonel,
with an adjutant; but I find, by the orders lately
received, that a battalion of four companies is only
entitled to a major and acting adjutant. I will notify
Captain Hunt of this change at as early a moment as
I can communicate with him. I am pleased to find
by the despatches that in this matter I have anticipated
the wish of the department.</p>

<p>Last season there was a great scarcity of provisions
on the coast of California; but when the stores are
received that are now on their way, there will be
an ample supply for the coming winter. The crops in
this country have been very fine this season, and at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">386</a></span>
present wheat is plenty and cheap at San Francisco.
Beef is also plenty. Beans can be purchased at the
southern ports, and sugar imported from the Sandwich
Islands; but for all other subsistence stores we
are dependent upon the South American ports or
those of the United States. I have directed Captain
Marcy, acting commissary of subsistence at this post,
to supply the chief of his department with the market
price of all kinds of provisions, with such other facts
as may enable his department to act with the proper
economy. The want of good clothing for the regulars
and volunteers is already felt in California; and unless
a supply has already been despatched, many of the
garrisons will be without shoes and proper clothing
this winter. The price of such articles here is so
exorbitant as to place them beyond the reach of the
soldiers. The volunteer clothing brought by Sutler
Haight has already been disposed of to citizens and
soldiers, and there are no means of his renewing the
supply except by sending to the United States. Justice
to the soldier demands that he either be comfortably
clad by the government, or that it should be within
his power to clothe himself on the allowance provided
for that purpose by law.</p>

<p>I respectfully recommend, if it has not already been
done, that a large supply of infantry undress winter
clothing be sent immediately to this country, to be
distributed, so as to enable each volunteer to purchase
for his own immediate use at cost prices. No summer
clothing is needed, as the climate is too severe, summer
and winter. Such articles as good blankets, cloth
overcoats, caps, jackets, overalls, stockings, and shoes
with stout shirts and drawers, are the only ones that
will ever be needed here.

<p>General orders No. 10, of 1847, promotes Lieutenant
Loeser, third artillery, and orders him to join
his company. I regret that at this moment his services
cannot be spared, and I am compelled to retain him
on duty with company F, third artillery, because the
absence of Captain Tompkins, the death of Lieutenant
Minor, and Lieutenant Sherman being detached as
acting assistant adjutant general, has reduced the
number of officers of that company to but two&mdash;Lieutenants
Ord and Loeser. I trust that the two
companies of regulars in this country will be kept with
a full supply of officers, that an officer, upon being
promoted, may be enabled to join the army in the
field, and participate in the active operations to which
he looks for distinction and experience.</p>

<p>Captain H. M. Naglee, seventh New York volunteers,
with a strong detachment of his company, is
now absent in pursuit of Indians in the valley of the
San Joaquin. He has with him Lieutenant Burton's
company of California volunteers, which is expected
to return to Monterey before the end of this month;
in which case I shall cause it to be mustered out of
service, and discharged on the 31st day of October.</p>

<p>Again I have to report the death, by sickness, of
an officer of my command&mdash;Lieutenant C. C. Anderson,
seventh New York volunteers, who contracted a
fever when on duty at Fort Sacramento, and died in
consequence at San Francisco on the 13th of September.
He was buried with military honors by the troops
at San Francisco, under direction of Major Hardie.
This death reduces the number of officers in Captain
Brackett's company, seventh regiment New York
volunteers, to one captain and one second lieutenant.</p>

<p>Commodore Shubrick will sail for the west coast of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">388</a></span>
Mexico from this harbor next week; and having made
application to me, I have directed Lieutenant Halleck,
of the engineer corps, to accompany him, and shall
give Lieutenant Colonel Burton, in command at La
Paz, Lower California, authority to accompany Commodore
Shubrick, should the latter design an attack
upon any point or points of the west coast of Mexico,
with orders, of course, to resume his position at La
Paz as soon as the object is accomplished for which
his command is desired.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;Colonel Burton will be directed to leave a
sufficient number of men at La Paz to keep the flag
flying.</p>

<p>It affords me much pleasure to assure the department
that the most perfect harmony subsists between
the members of the naval and land forces on this coast,
and that the most friendly intercourse is kept up
between the officers. I have had frequent occasion
myself to ask assistance of Commodores Biddle and
Shubrick, and my requests have been granted with
promptness and politeness; and in return I have
afforded them all the assistance in my power. Our
consultations have been frequent and perfectly harmonious,
resulting, I hope, in the advancement of the
common cause of our country.</p>

<p class="p2">We have already given the substance of Governor
Mason's despatch to the government, giving an account
of the gold discovery and a visit to the <i>placers</i>.
There is, therefore, no necessity for inserting that
official document. The appearance in Upper California,
in July 1848, of Don Pio Pico, the former governor
of the territory, gave rise to serious apprehensions
of another insurrection. The despatch of Col.
Stephenson, the commander of the garrison at Los
Angeles, to Colonel Mason, contains an account of the
matter, together with a description of the ex-governor.</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Headquarters Southern Military District</span>,</p>
<p class="left45"><i>Los Angeles, California, July 20, 1848</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: By the last mail I informed you of the arrival
of Don Pio Pico in this district. I subsequently
learned that he had passed through San Diego without
presenting himself to Captain Shannon, or in any
manner reporting his arrival. Immediately after his
arrival, rumors reached me of conversations had by
him with his countrymen, in which he stated that he
had returned with full powers to resume his gubernatorial
functions, and that he had only to exhibit his credentials
to you to have the civil government turned
over to him. I found the people becoming very much
excited, and some rather disposed to be imprudent. I
sent for Jose Ant. Carrillo and some others in the
town, who were giving currency to these reports, and
informed them that I should hold them responsible
for any imprudent or indiscreet act of their countrymen,
and that, at the first appearance of any disrespect
to the American authorities, I should arrest
and confine them in the guard-house. This had the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">390</a></span>
effect to check all excitement here; but as Don Pio
removed up the country, the same excitement began
to spread among the rancheros. In the mean time,
his brother Andreas informed me that he, Don Pio,
would come in and report to me in person in a few
days, as soon as he had recovered from the fatigue
of his journey. On Saturday, the 15th instant, he
reached the ranch of an Englishman named Workman,
some eighteen miles from here. This man has
ever been hostile to the American cause and interest,
and is just the man to advise Pico not to come in and
report to me.</p>

<p>On Sunday and Monday I was advised that many
Californians had visited Pico at Workman's, and that
the same story had been told them of his having returned
to resume his gubernatorial functions, &amp;c., and
also that he should not report to me, but go direct to
San Fernando, from whence he would communicate
with you. The moment I became satisfied that he
intended to adopt this course, I issued an order (copy
inclosed) requiring him to report to me immediately
in person. I sent my adjutant with a detachment of
men to the ranch of Workman to deliver to Don Pio
in person a copy of this order, with instructions to
bring him in by force, in case he refused or even
hesitated to obey. The adjutant returned here at
twelve o'clock on Monday with information that the
Don had left for San Fernando. I immediately despatched
Lieutenant Davidson with a detachment of
dragoons and a copy of the order, with instructions
similar to those given Adjutant Bonnycastle. About
five o'clock on Tuesday morning I received a visit
from a gentleman named Reed, living at the mission
of San Gabriel, who informed me that Don Pio Pico
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">391</a></span>
had arrived at his house quite late in the evening of
Monday, on his way to San Fernando. Reed inquired
if he did not intend reporting to me in person; he
answered in the negative; when Reed assured him,
if he attempted to pass my post without reporting, I
would cause him to be arrested, and that he was
aware of my being displeased at his passing through
San Diego without reporting to the commandant of
that post. Don Pio Pico, upon receiving this information,
became alarmed, and requested Reed to come
in and see me, to say he intended no disrespect, and
would come and report at any hour I would name.
Reed is a highly respectable man, and has ever been
friendly to the American cause; and I gave him a
copy of the order I had issued in regard to Don Pio,
requesting him to deliver it, and say to Don Pio, he
could come in at any hour he chose, within twenty-four
hours. Accordingly about eight P.M., the same
evening, the ex-governor came in. He was unaccompanied
even by a servant, evidently desiring it should
not be known he was in town. I received him kindly,
told him I had no desire to treat him harshly, but that
the American authorities must be respected, and if he
had not come in I should certainly have arrested him.
He informed me that he left Guaynas on the 22d of
May, crossed to Mulige, which he left for California
on June third, and arrived at San Diego, July sixth.
He says that when he left Guaynas nothing had been
heard of the action of the Mexican Congress upon
the treaty, but it was generally supposed it would be
ratified. He says the Mexican government did not
answer any of his communications; and the moment
he saw the armistice published in a newspaper, he
determined to return home, as he supposed he could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">392</a></span>
return with credit, under the stipulations of the
armistice. He brings with him no other authority
for his return, and says he desires to live peaceably,
and attend to his private affairs. He denies ever
having said that he came back with powers to resume
his gubernatorial functions, and that he rebuked such
of his friends as he had seen for their last attempt at
a revolution, and advises that they remain quiet and
obey the laws, as no part of the people of the conquered
Mexican territory have been treated as kindly
as the Californians have been by the American authorities.
He thanked me for my personal kindness
to his family and countrymen in general, and said if
I would permit him he would go to San Fernando,
from whence he would answer that part of my order
which required a written communication from him. I
gave him permission to leave, and offered him an
escort, which he thanked me for, but declined. Don
Pio Pico is about five feet seven inches high, corpulent,
very dark, with strongly-marked African features;
he is, no doubt, an amiable, kind hearted man,
who has ever been the tool of knaves; he does not
appear to possess more intelligence than the rancheros
generally do; he can sign his name, but I am informed
he cannot write a connected letter; hence, as
he informed me, he would be compelled to send for
his former secretary before he could answer my order
or communicate with you, which he advised me he
intended doing. I have promised to take charge of
and forward any communication he may choose to
make you. He left town on Wednesday morning very
early, as obscurely as he had entered it; and those
who advised him to assume the bombastic tone he did
upon his first arrival, have done him irreparable injury
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">393</a></span>
for he is now ridiculed by many who before entertained
a high respect for him.</p>

<p class="p2">On the 13th of April, 1849, Colonel Mason at his
own request, was relieved from the post of Governor
of California, and Brigadier-General Riley took his
place. The despatch of that officer, dated 30th of
June, following his assuming the duties of his post,
is important, as containing an account of the state of
feeling in California, upon the subject of the laws at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">394</a></span>
that time in force, and the difficulties with various assemblies
elected in the northern part of the territories.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Executive Department of California</span>,</p>
<p class="left65"><i>Monterey, June 30, 1849</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">General</span>: I have the honor to transmit herewith
copies of all civil correspondence and papers since
the 13th of April last, at which time I relieved Colonel
Mason from his duties as Governor of California.</p>

<p>It was (with the advice of Colonel Mason) my intention,
on assuming the direction of civil affairs in
this country, to complete the organization of the existing
government; at the same time to call a convention
for forming a State Constitution, or plan of territorial
government, to be submitted to Congress for its approval.
But on further consultation it was deemed best
to postpone all action on this subject, until I could
ascertain what had been done in Congress. On the
first instant I received reliable information by the
steamer "Edith" that that body had adjourned without
organizing any territorial government for this
country; and accordingly, on the 3d instant I issued
my proclamation to the people of California, defining
what was understood to be the legal position of affairs
here, and pointing out the course it was deemed advisable
to pursue in order to procure a new political
organization better adapted to the character and
present condition of the country. The course indicated
in my proclamation will be adopted by the
people, almost unanimously, and there is now little or
no doubt that the convention will meet on the first of
September next and form a State Constitution, to be
submitted to Congress in the early part of the coming
session.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">395</a></span></p>

<p>A few prefer a territorial organization, but I think
a majority will be in favor of a State government, so
as to avoid all further difficulties respecting the question
of slavery. This question will probably be submitted,
together with the Constitution, to a direct vote
of the people, in order that the wishes of the people
of California may be clearly and fully expressed. Of
course, the Constitution or plan of territorial government
formed by this convention can have no legal
force till approved by Congress.</p>

<p>On the receipt of the treaty of peace with Mexico,
doubt was entertained by a portion of the people here
respecting what constituted the legal government and
laws of the country. A few contended that all
government and all laws in California were at an end,
and that therefore the people, in their sovereign
capacity, might make such government and laws as
they should deem proper. Accordingly, in two of the
northern districts, local legislative assemblies were
organized, and laws enacted for the government of
the people of these districts. The members of the
Sonoma assembly, however, soon became convinced
of their error, and that body was dissolved. But in
San Francisco the assembly continued its sessions,
making laws, creating and filling offices, imposing and
collecting taxes, without the authority and in violation
of law, and finally went so far as to abolish the office
of alcalde, whose records and papers were seized and
forcibly removed from his custody. On receiving
official information of these facts, I issued my proclamation
of the 4th instant. Since then I have made
a personal visit to San Francisco, and find that the
more respectable members of the so-called district
assembly are convinced of the impropriety of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">396</a></span>
course pursued by that body, and in a very short time
I think all the difficulties will be amicably arranged.
These difficulties arose in part from a misapprehension
as to what constituted the legal government of
the country, and in part from the unpopularity of the
first alcalde of that district, against whom serious
charges had been made. Unfortunately, there was
at the time no legal tribunal for investigating these
charges; and, there being no other magistrate in that
district, I could not, with propriety, remove him from
office. A new election, however, will soon be held to
supply his place; and on the organization of the
"superior court," the charges against him can be
properly investigated.</p>

<p>The publication of a portion of the instructions
received from Washington respecting the government
of this country, and the disposition manifested by the
authorities here to enforce the existing laws, have
done much to remove the erroneous opinions which
were for a time entertained by a portion of the people
of California. The civil government of this country
has been, and will continue to be, administered on the
principle laid down by the Supreme Court of the
United States, viz: on the transfer of the ceded
territory, it has never been held that the relations of
the inhabitants with each other undergo any change.
Their relations with their former sovereign are dissolved,
and new relations are created between them
and the government which has acquired their territory.
The mere act which transfers their country transfers
the allegiance of those who remain in it; and the law
which may be denominated political is necessarily
changed, although that which regulates the intercourse
and general conduct of individuals remains in force
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">397</a></span>
until altered by the newly-created power of the
State.</p>

<p>The treaty is the law of the land, and admits the
inhabitants of [California] to the enjoyment of the
privileges, rights, and immunities of citizens of the
United States. It is unnecessary to inquire whether
this is not their condition, independent of stipulation.
They do not, however, participate in political power;
they do not share in the government till [California]
shall become a State. In the mean time, [California]
continues to be a territory of the United States,
governed by virtue of that clause of the constitution
which empowers Congress to make all needful rules
and regulations respecting the territory and other
property belonging to the United States.</p>

<p>When we take into consideration the great mass of
floating population of the United States and of other
countries&mdash;people of all nations, kindreds and tongues&mdash;which
has been suddenly thrown into this country,
it must be acknowledged that every thing has, thus
far, remained remarkably quiet, and that the amount
of crime has been much less than might, under the
circumstances, have reasonably been expected. It is
to be feared, however, that during the coming winter,
when large numbers of the miners collect in the towns,
public order may be occasionally disturbed. But it is
believed that in the mean time a more complete organization
of the existing government will be effected, so
as to enable the authorities to enforce the laws with
greater regularity and efficiency.</p>

<p>Rumors have reached me that there is no very
amicable feeling existing between the Americans and
foreigners in the gold regions, and that the former
are disposed to forcibly expel the latter from the placer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">398</a></span>
districts. I shall soon visit the valleys of the Sacramento
and San Joaquin, and hope to be able to report
upon the true state of affairs there by the August
steamer. As Congress has declined passing any laws
restricting the working of the placers, I shall not
deem myself authorized to interfere in this matter, any
further than may be necessary to preserve the public
tranquillity. Indeed there is much reason to believe
that Congress has pursued the best policy, under the
circumstances, in leaving the placers open to all; for
it would be exceedingly difficult to enforce any regulations
not absolutely required by the necessity of the
case, and it is more than probable that any attempt
at this time to rent out the mineral lands, or to tax
their products, would involve a great expense, and it
is quite possible that such an attempt would lead to
very serious difficulties. Of the large numbers who
have been attracted to this country by the flattering
prospect of sudden wealth, and with the intention of
returning to their former homes to enjoy their gains,
many foreigners as well as Americans are becoming
established in business, and will make California their
permanent place of residence. It is therefore well
worthy of serious consideration whether the present
system may not prove equally beneficial with that of
a more exclusive policy. It certainly conduces much
towards developing the resources of the country, extending
its commerce, and rapidly augmenting its
wealth and population. As soon as I have made a
personal examination of the gold regions, I shall be
prepared to express my views on this subject; but I
cannot omit the present occasion to urge upon the
government the importance of establishing a mint in
California, with the least possible delay.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">399</a></span></p>

<p>Information, not official, has been received, that the
revenue laws of the United States have been extended
over this country, and that a collector and deputies
may soon be expected to take charge of the collection
of revenue in this district. On their arrival, all custom-houses
and custom-house property will be turned
over to them, and the temporary collectors employed
by my predecessor and by myself will be discharged.
The moneys collected during and since the war, under
the direction of the governor of California, and not
required for defraying the expenses of the civil government,
will be kept as a separate and distinct fund,
subject to the disposition of Congress. The grounds
upon which this revenue has been collected since the
declaration of peace, are fully stated in a letter to the
collector of San Francisco, dated the 24th of February
last. It may be proper to add, that the course pursued
by my predecessor was rendered absolutely
necessary by the peculiar circumstances of the case.
The wants of the country rendered it imperative upon
him to permit the landing of foreign goods in this
territory; and had this been done without the collection
of duties, large amounts of dutiable goods would
have been placed in depot on this coast, to the manifest
injury of the revenue and prejudice to our own
merchants. The importers have sold their goods at
such prices as to cover the duties paid, and still leave
them enormous profits; and to now return these
duties to the importers would be a virtual gift, without
in any way benefitting the people of California. But,
to expend this money in objects of public utility in
the country, would confer a lasting benefit upon all.
I would therefore recommend that such portions of
these moneys as may be left, after defraying the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">400</a></span>
expenses of the existing civil government, be given to
California as a "school fund," to be exclusively devoted
to purposes of education. No difficulty has been
experienced in enforcing the tariff of 1846, and the revenue
has been collected at a very moderate expense,
considering the peculiar circumstances of the times.</p>

<p>All officers of the civil government of California
will be paid out of the "civil fund" arising from the
customs, the salaries fixed by law, and I would recommend
that those officers of the army and navy who
have been employed as collectors and receivers of
customs in California, both during and since the war,
be allowed a fair per centage on the money which
they have collected and disbursed. Two and a half
per cent. on the amount collected, with the restriction
contained in section 2 of the Act of March 3, 1849,
is deemed a fair allowance for collecting these customs,
and two and a half per cent. on the amount actually
expended is deemed ample compensation for keeping
and accounting for the same. It would be more just
and proper to make the allowance for the <i>actual expenditures</i>
than for receiving and keeping these
moneys; because, if the reversed rule were established,
officers who have received large sums, and within a
few days transferred them to others, with no other
trouble than merely passing receipts, would be entitled
to a higher pay than those who have had all the
trouble of expending this money in small sums, and in
keeping and rendering accounts of these expenditures.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_420.jpg" width="550" height="343" alt="Untitled" />
</div>

<p>As soon as these "civil funds" can be collected
from the officers now holding them, it is proposed to
place them in the hands of some officer, or other
responsible person, who will act as treasurer for the
civil government, with a fixed compensation for his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">401</a></span>
services. On the arrival of the regular collector and
deputies, appointed according to law, a full statement
will be made of all the moneys which have been collected
in California, and the papers and accounts connected
with the expenditure of this civil fund will be
sent to Washington, as heretofore, in order that all
officers who shall receive or expend the same may be
held to a strict accountability.</p>

<p class="p2">Governor Riley took occasion to make an excursion
through the gold regions, soon after his affairs with
the assemblies were disposed of. A reconnoisance
of the valleys of the Sacramento and San Joaquin was
made, and particular care given to the matter of establishing
military posts for defending the miners and
others from the attacks of the Indians. After his return
to Monterey, the following despatch was sent to the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">402</a></span>
from the headquarters of the army; and, as I cannot
have copied in season for transmission by the steamer
of the 1st proximo the military correspondence at
these headquarters, I respectfully submit, for the information
of the commander-in-chief, a brief summary
of reports heretofore made in relation to military
affairs in this department.</p>

<p>My attention was directed, on my arrival in this
country, to the unparalleled excitement in relation to
the mineral regions; the imminent danger that our
troops, as they arrived, would desert to the "<i>placers</i>,"
and, instead of giving protection to the parties, and
aid in the preservation of order and tranquillity, would
themselves become the very worst element of disorder;
the great extent of Indian frontier to be
guarded, and the difficulties then apprehended from
the unsettled state of affairs in the mining districts.
An attentive consideration of these subjects impressed
me with the opinion that the policy most likely to
prove advantageous to the service, would be the concentration
of all the troops serving in this department,
except the necessary guards for the depots at one or
more points in the immediate vicinity of the gold
regions, from whence a portion of them might be permitted
to visit the placers for the purpose of working
them for their own benefit&mdash;the remainder to be held
embodied in a proper state of discipline, in readiness
for any emergency that might occur. After the expiration
of the furlough of the first class, a second
class to be furloughed, and so in succession with the
remainder; the troops stationed at points so distant
from the mines, that they could not be furloughed, to
be relieved by exchange with commands that have
been more favorably situated. The practice of granting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">403</a></span>
furloughs, adopted at some of the posts in this
country, with the sanction of the former department
commander, had succeeded well, and the information
received about the time of my arrival from the southern
part of this department confirmed me in the
opinion previously entertained, that the mania for gold-hunting
would exist, in its most exaggerated form, at
points most remote from the <i>placers</i>. I accordingly,
immediately after relieving Colonel Mason in the
command of the department, recommended the adoption
of the policy above indicated. It is a matter of
regret, that the emergencies of the service have been
such that it could not be carried out to the extent recommended;
for the experience of the past four
months has convinced me that it is the only course
that can be adopted, with reasonable hope of success,
until the state of affairs in this country is materially
changed. In addition to the mere question of expediency,
Indian difficulties that were then occurring,
and the threatening danger of a proximate collision
between the different classes at work in the gold region,
made it highly important that a strong military
force should be established in the immediate vicinity
of the mining region.</p>

<p>For the disposition of the troops in the department,
and the measures taken to prevent desertions, &amp;c., I
respectfully refer to department order and special
orders forwarded to you by this mail. These furnish
you with a history of the operations in the department
since my assumption of the command. The present
disposition of the troops is the same as indicated in
orders No. 16, except that company A, 2d infantry,
re-inforced by details from other companies&mdash;in all,
four officers and eighty men&mdash;has been detached, under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">404</a></span>
instructions from the commander of the division,
as an escort for Captain Warner, topographical engineers,
and company E, 1st dragoons, when <i>en route</i>
for the station, was diverted from that route, for the
purpose of securing the perpetrators of some murders
committed by Indians on or near Los Reyes River.</p>

<p>The difficulties apprehended from a collision between
the different classes of the mining population
have not yet occurred in the form which it was feared
they would assume, and at present I do not apprehend
any serious difficulty from that source. Some serious
Indian disturbances have occurred on the American
fork of the Sacramento, and a few isolated murders
have occurred at other points; but at the date of the
last report from the frontier, every thing was quiet.
The Indians of the Sierra Nevada, although in a great
number, are of a degraded class, and are divided into
so many different tribes, or rancherias, speaking different
languages, that any combination on their part is
scarcely to be apprehended. Their depredations
heretofore have been confined generally to horse-stealing,
and only occasionally have murders been committed
by them. These, however, have been made
the pretence, by the whites in their neighborhood, for
the commission of outrages of the most aggravated
character&mdash;in one or two cases involving in an indiscriminate
massacre the wild Indians of the Sierra
and the tame Indians of the ranchos. The commanders
of detachments serving on the Indian frontiers are
instructed to prevent any authorized interference with
the Indians by the whites, and to support the Indian
agents of their districts in the exercise of their appropriate
duties. From the character of the mining
population, and the nature of their occupations, unless
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">405</a></span>
a strong military force be maintained on that frontier,
it will be impossible to prevent the commission of outrages
upon the Indians; and they, in turn, will be
avenged by murders committed upon isolated parties
of whites. Unfortunately, the eagerness with which
gold is sought after by detached parties of miners,
gives many opportunities for the commission of such
outrages. To seek after and apprehend the perpetrators
in cases of this kind, a mounted force is absolutely
necessary; and, although great difficulty will
be experienced in obtaining forage and replacing
horses that may be disabled, its services are so indispensably
necessary, that I greatly regret my inability
to supply more than one company on the Indian frontier
until after the company now on duty with the
commissioner of the boundary survey is relieved.</p>

<p>I have heretofore called the attention of the War
Department and the division commander to the insufficiency
of the force assigned to this department
by general order No. 49 of 1848. As it may not be
possible, with the present military establishment, to
order any additional force to this country without the
action of Congress, I respectfully invite the attention
of the commanding general to the views heretofore
expressed on this subject. A topographical sketch
of a portion of this department is herewith inclosed,
upon which I have indicated the positions or neighborhoods
in which I deem it important that troops
should be established. The amount and character of
the force required in my report to division headquarters,
of June 11, is also inclosed.</p>

<p>The embarrassments under which the service has
labored will be so readily appreciated at home, that
it is unnecessary to refer to them here except to say
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">406</a></span>
that, great as these embarrassments have been, they
have been greatly increased by the want of line and
staff officers.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">GOING TO A FANDANGO.</p>
</div>

<p>In consequence of the extraordinary prices of labor,
and the consequent enormous expenditures in this country,
young officers of the line should not be, in justice to
the service and themselves, as they have unnecessarily
been, encumbered, in addition to their company duties,
with money and property responsibilities to a very
great amount. Experienced officers of the quartermaster's
department are required at San Francisco,
San Diego, and with the commands on the upper Sacramento
and San Joaquin Rivers. I have now but
one officer, Captain Kane, of that department, under
my control; and he is necessarily detained at department
headquarters in the preparation of my estimates
for the services of the ensuing year. Quarters must
soon be erected at several of the posts in this department;
and I cannot spare line officers for this duty,
without destroying their efficiency with their companies,
even were it proper to do so. There are no topographical
engineers on duty in this department, and,
in consequence of the want, I have been able to perform
very little of the duty devolved upon me by the
111th paragraph general orders No. 49, of 1848. A
reconnoissance of a portion of the valleys of the Sacramento
and San Joaquin Rivers, undertaken for the
purpose of determining the position to be occupied, as
recommended in my report to division headquarters
of April 16, to the War Department of the 25th of
the same month, has strengthened my opinion of the
importance of giving the country a most thorough
examination before any military posts are permanently
located in the interior. The whole district of country
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">407</a></span>
lying between the coast range and the Sierra Nevada
is exceedingly sickly at certain seasons of the year.
The common timber of the country (oak) is not fit for
building purposes; and I was greatly disappointed in
finding that south of the Sacramento River, pine fit
for lumber exists only on the spur of the mountains
in small quantities, and in places difficult of access.
Stone, as a building material is scarce; and at several
of the points where it may be desirable to establish
military posts, grain for forage is out of the question,
and grass can only be found in exceedingly limited
quantities. I expressed a hope in my despatches to
the War Department of June 30, that I would be able
to make an examination of the country along the
western slope of the Sierra Nevada, from the source
of the San Joaquin to the southern boundary of California;
but the season is now so far advanced that I
fear I shall not be able to accomplish more than the
determination of a position to be occupied in the
neighborhood of Los Reyes River. It is of great importance
that this point should be determined as
soon as possible; for the new discoveries of gold
constantly being made in that direction, are attracting
thither a large portion of the mining
population. The rapidly increasing population of the
northern <i>placers</i> is gradually forcing the Indians to
the south, and congregating them on the waters of the
Lake Buena Vista, (Tula.) This position should be
occupied, if possible, before the miners have become
established in Los Reyes and the neighboring rivers;
and the necessary examinations and arrangements will
be made as soon as it is possible to do so.</p>

<p>Since my application (April 25) for officers of the
quartermaster's department was made, two officers of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">408</a></span>
that corps, Majors Allen and Fitzgerald, whom I had
supposed would be available for duty in this department,
have been permanently separated from it; and
the number then applied for should be increased by
two.</p>

<p>Two of the medical officers in this department are
now prostrated by disease; and as their places cannot
be supplied here, there should be at least three in this
department, in addition to those actually required for
duty at the different posts in the department, to meet
emergencies of this kind.</p>

<p>The ordnance depots at Monterey and San Francisco
are under the charge of military store-keepers.
It is important, for the preservation of this property
in a serviceable condition, that they should be under
the supervision of an experienced ordnance officer.</p>

<p>With the exception of the assistant quartermaster
above referred to, the officers above enumerated have
heretofore been applied for; but as none have been
reported to me, I will state in detail what officers are
absolutely required with this command:</p>

<p><i>Four</i> officers of the quartermaster's department in
addition to Captain Kane now on duty here:</p>

<p><i>Two</i> topographical engineers:</p>

<p><i>Three</i> additional medical officers:</p>

<p><i>One</i> officer of the ordnance department:</p>

<p><i>One</i> officer of the subsistence department.</p>

<p>The irregular communication with some of the interior
posts, creates a good deal of embarrassment by
delaying the department returns. In consequence of
this I am unable to furnish a later return than for
June. The transport Mary and Adeline, with companies
A and F, 2d infantry, reached San Francisco
on the 8th ultimo. The detachment of dragoons, on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">409</a></span>
their march to the department with the collector of
this district and the Arkansas emigrants, have not
yet arrived. During the months of July and August,
so far as reports have been received, there were but
few desertions, except from the company detailed for
the escort of Captain Warner, topographical engineers;
thirty-four men, more than half the whole number
reported, have deserted from this company. The
entire force in the department at this time does not
probably exceed six hundred and fifty, (aggregate;)
and consequently more than four hundred recruits are
now required to fill up these companies to the standard
authorized for this department.</p>

<p>A detailed report of my reconnoissance in the valleys
of the San Joaquin and Sacramento will be forwarded
by the next steamer. I have delayed it in
order to embody in it information in regard to the
country in the neighborhood of the Tula, which I am
in the daily expectation of receiving.</p>

<p>The want of company officers is very much felt; and
I request that authority may be given me to break up
the companies whose captains are permanently absent,
transferring the officers to other companies, as their
services may be needed.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be, very respectfully, colonel,
your obedient servant,</p>

<p class="p2">In the early part of 1848, Lieut. H. W. Halleck,
of the Engineers, was ordered to make a reconnoisance
of the coast of Lower California, with reference
to the location of works of military defence. In his
report to Colonel Mason, after giving a general description
of the coast and harbors, and proposing a
system of military defence, he submits some remarks
upon the commercial and military importance of the
peninsula. The whole report is interesting, and furnishes
the most correct information upon the subject
of the reconnoisance. It will form an interesting
conclusion to a work which has been principally
devoted to a description and history of Upper California.</p>

<p class="left45"><span class="smcap">La Paz</span>, <i>April 12, 1848</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: In compliance with the instructions of the
commanding general of the department to make a
"reconnoisance of the coast of California, with reference
to the location of works of military defence," I
reported in my last upon so much as relates to the
upper province, and I now submit a few remarks on
the military defence of the peninsula of Lower California.</p>

<p>I. <i>General description of the coast and harbors.</i>&mdash;The
principal ports of the coast of Lower California,
visited by whaling and merchant vessels, are San
Quintin, Magdalena, San Jose, La Paz, Escondido (near
Loreto), and Mulige.&mdash;There are some other points
which vessels occasionally touch for supplies and at
trade, but they are comparatively of little commercial
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">411</a></span>
or military importance. The port of San Quintin,
in latitude thirty degrees twenty-three minutes, is represented
as affording a secure anchorage for vessels
of every description, and to be sufficiently commodious
for the reception of a numerous fleet. The extensive
bay of Magdalena has acquired considerable
notoriety from its being resorted to every winter by
large numbers of whaling vessels. Its size gives it
the character of an inland sea, its waters being navigable
for the distance of more than a hundred miles.
It furnishes several places of safe and commodious
anchorage. The bay of San Jose, near Cape Saint
Lucas, is much frequented by coasting vessels, and
occasionally visited by whalers and men-of-war. Being
the outlet of a fertile valley, extending some
forty or fifty miles into the interior, it is probably the
best place in the peninsula for supplying shipping
with water and fresh provisions. It is, however, a
mere roadstead, affording no protection whatever during
the season of southeasters.</p>

<p>La Paz is the seat of government and the principal
port of Lower California, and its extensive bay
affords excellent places of anchorage for vessels of
any size, and is sufficiently commodious for the most
numerous fleets. The principal pearl fisheries are
in this immediate vicinity, and also the most valuable
mining districts. It is the outlet of the fertile
valley of the Todos Santos, and of the produce of
the whole country between Santiago and Loreto.
The cove or estero, opposite the town of La Paz, furnishes
spacious and safe anchorage, which may be
reached by vessels drawing not more than eighteen
or twenty feet of water; and the cove of Pichilingue,
at the south-eastern extremity of the bay, and about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">412</a></span>
six miles from the town, affords an excellent anchorage
for vessels of any size; but the inner bay can be
reached only by small merchant vessels. The bar,
however, between the two is only a few yards in extent;
and if the importance of the place should ever
justify it, the channel might be made deeper without
difficulty or great expense. The adjacent country
being barren and mountainous, and the roads to the
interior exceedingly difficult, this place can never be
the outlet of much agricultural produce. But as the
island of Carmen, nearly opposite the entrance to
this bay, contains an almost inexhaustible supply of
salt, very easy of access, it is possible that the trade
in this article may eventually give considerable importance
to the port of Escondido.</p>

<p>The bay of Mulige contains several places of anchorage,
but none of them are deemed safe for large
vessels, or even from small vessels, at all seasons of
the year. There are also several other parts in the
gulf farther north which are occasionally visited by
coasting vessels, but it is not known that any of them
are likely to be of much commercial importance.</p>

<p>II. <i>Proposed system of defence.</i>&mdash;It is not supposed
that, under existing circumstances, any military
post will be necessary on the western coast of the
peninsula; nor is it probable that, for many years,
any place there will become of sufficient importance
to justify the construction of military works for its
defence. It is true that the whale fishery on this
coast has become, from the amount of shipping engaged
in it, an object of the highest consideration;
but our having ports of refuge at San Francisco or
San Diego, and at La Paz, strong enough to resist a
naval coup de main, will, it is believed, afford sufficient
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">413</a></span>
security to these whalers in case of a war with a
maritime power.</p>

<p>On our arrival here in October last, it was deemed
desirable to establish a small military post at San
Jose, for the double purpose of giving protection to
the friendly inhabitants against a band of Mexican
freebooters who had crossed the gulf from Guaynas
to Mulige and Loreto, and of preventing the further
introduction of men and munitions from the opposite
coast. The old mission building was found well
adapted to the purpose in view, and with a few
repairs and improvements served as an admirable protection
for the little garrison in the several attacks
which it afterwards sustained from greatly superior
forces. It will probably be necessary to continue
this post during the war with Mexico, or at least so
long as there is any danger of the enemy's sending
troops from the opposite coast to again disturb the
tranquillity of the peninsula; but it is not deemed advisable
to establish at this place any works of permanent
defence, the character of the port not being such
as to warrant expenditures for this purpose. The
defences of the cuartel or mission building are deemed
sufficient for all purposes of temporary occupation.</p>

<p>Should the war with Mexico continue, and the
naval forces be again withdrawn from the gulf, it may
be necessary to establish temporarily a small military
post at Mulige; but no permanent garrison will be
required either at that place or Escondido, unless,
perhaps, hereafter the commercial importance of the
latter port should justify such a measure.</p>

<p>La Paz is, therefore, the only port in Lower California
which it will be necessary, for the present, to
occupy with a permanent military force, or to secure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">414</a></span>
by means of fortifications. For temporary purposes,
the site of the old cuartel is well suited
for the construction of defensive barracks, inasmuch
as it commands the town, and may readily be
secured against an attack from the side. The
buildings at present occupied as barracks are not
judiciously located. A permanent work on Punta
Colorada will completely close the entrance to
Pichilingue cove, and its heavy guns will reach the
entrance to the channel of La Paz; but to give the
requisite security to the latter, a small battery will be
necessary on Punta Prieta. The topographical features
of both these points are favorable for the construction
of small fortifications: Stone of good
quality for building purposes is found in the immediate
vicinity, and good lime may be procured at the
distance of only a few miles. Quarries have been
opened in the "Calaveras," and the stone, though
soft and easily worked, is found to be in this climate
of a very durable character. La Paz is not difficult
to defend against a naval attack, and the proposed
fortifications may be constructed in a short time and
without a very large expenditure of money. The commercial
character of the place, its military importance
as connected with the defence of the peninsula,
its great value as a naval depôt and port of refuge
for our commercial and military marine in case of war
with any naval power, will, it is believed, fully justify
the expenditures necessary for securing this port
against a maritime attack.</p>

<p>III. <i>Commercial and military importance of Lower
California.</i>&mdash;Thus far in my report I have proceeded
on the supposition that it is the intention of our government
to retain the whole of California in any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">415</a></span>
treaty of peace with Mexico; but doubts have recently
been expressed on the policy of retaining this
peninsula, on account of its being of little or no value
to the United States. As the guerrilla forces which
were sent over from Mexico the past summer, during
the absence of our squadron from this coast, to regain
possession of Lower California, and force the inhabitants
to their allegiance to the Mexican government,
have been defeated and completely dispersed, leaving
our own troops in undisputed possession of the territory,
nothing but a conviction of the utter worthlessness
of the country could now induce our government
to consent to its abandonment. On this subject I
beg leave to add a few remarks:</p>

<p>The peninsula of California lies between twenty-two
degrees fifty minutes and thirty-two degrees thirty
minutes north latitude, being about seven hundred
miles in length, and varying from fifty to one hundred
miles in breadth. An irregular chain or broken ridge of
mountains extend from Cape St. Lucas to the frontiers
of Upper California, with spurs running off on each
side to the gulf and ocean. Between these spurs are
numerous broad plains covered with stunted trees,
and during the rainy months with a thin but nutricious
grass. In the dry season this grass is parched
up like hay, but from its nutricious character it affords
abundant food for the herds of cattle and horses
which constitute the principal wealth of rancheros.
The dryness of the soil prevent the growth of trees
of any considerable magnitude, except on the borders
of a few mountain streams. This timber, though far
from being plentiful, is exceedingly durable and much
esteemed in ship-building. The greatest height of the
mountains is estimated five thousand feet; many of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">416</a></span>
them are piles of mere broken rocks, while others are
covered with grass, shrubbery, and small trees. The
plains are sandy and mostly unproductive&mdash;not, however,
from any natural barrenness in the soil, but
from a deficiency of water. There are but few
durable streams in the whole country, and streams of
good water are extremely scarce. But in the plains
and most of the dry beds of rivers water can be obtained
by digging wells only a few feet in depth; and
wherever irrigation has been resorted to by means of
these wells, the produce of the soil, from its remarkable
fertility, has abundantly rewarded the labor of the
agriculturist. Much of this soil is of volcanic origin,
having been washed from the mountains by the action
of heavy rains, and the produce extracted by means
of irrigation from these apparently barren and unprolific
sands is something most marvellous. The
general aspect of the country on the coast is exceedingly
barren and forbidding, but I have seen no instance
where the soil is properly cultivated that the
labor bestowed on it is not well rewarded. The
growth of vegetation is exceedingly rapid, and the
soil and climate are such as to produce nearly all the
tropical fruits in great perfection. But the inhabitants
are disinclined to agriculture, and most of them
live indolent and roving lives, subsisting principally
upon their herds. Notwithstanding the unfavorable
character of the country, it is capable, in the hands
of an industrious and agricultural people, of supporting
a population much more numerous than the present.
In the time of the missions, when very small
portions of the soil were cultivated, and even these
but rudely, by the Indians, the four districts of San
Jose, Santiago, San Antonio, and Todos Santos contained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">417</a></span>
a population of thirty-five thousand souls,
whereas, the present population of the same districts
is only seven thousand.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_440.jpg" width="550" height="336" alt="SACRAMENTO CITY" />
<p class="caption">SACRAMENTO CITY.</p>
</div>

<p>The agricultural products of Lower California are
maize, sugar-cane, potatoes, dates, figs, grapes, quinces,
lemons, and olives. A considerable quantity of
hides, beef, cheese, soap, sugar, figs, raisins, &amp;c., is
annually exported to Mexico and Upper California,
flour and merchandise being received in exchange.
The vegetable market of Mazatlan is also in part
supplied from the valley of San José.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_442.jpg" width="550" height="360" alt="ONE OF THE OLD SPANISH HOUSES, SAN FRANCISCO" />
<p class="caption">ONE OF THE OLD SPANISH HOUSES, SAN FRANCISCO.</p>
</div>

<p>But the value of Lower California does not result
from its being either a grazing or agricultural country.
Its fisheries, mines, commerce, and the influence of
its geographical position, are matters of much higher
importance than its agricultural productions.</p>

<p>The whole coast of the peninsula abounds with fish;
clams and oysters are found in great plenty and of
every variety. The islands of the gulf abound with
seal, and the whaling grounds on the Pacific coast are
of great value. During the past year Magdalena
bay alone has, at one time, contained as many as
twenty-eight sail, all engaged in this fishery. The
pearl fishery is also exceedingly valuable. Formerly,
when it was conducted with system and regularity,
the annual produce of a single vessel with thirty or
forty divers, between the months of July and October,
usually amounted to about $60,000; and now, badly
as the fishery is conducted, the annual exportation of
pearls amounts to between forty and fifty thousand
dollars. Tortoise and pearl shells are also articles of
exportation.</p>

<p>Lower California contains valuable mines of gold,
silver, copper, and lead; but, for the want of capital,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">418</a></span>
very few of these are worked, and this in the rudest
manner possible. Nevertheless, the labor expended
on them is well rewarded; and there can be no doubt
that with capital and suitable means they would yield
very handsome profits. The salt mines on Carmen
island are capable of supplying the whole coast of
Mexico and California; already the duties on this
article amount to a considerable sum.</p>

<p>The commerce of the peninsula is now very limited,
being principally confined to a coasting trade with
the ports of Mexico. The whole population of the
country is but little more than ten thousand, and the
annual imports and exports are estimated at $300,000.
But in our hands this commerce, freed from the absurd
restrictions imposed by Mexico, will soon receive
a very great extension. La Paz will become the principal
depot of American goods for the western coast
of Mexico; and in a few years most foreign goods intended
for this coast will also be deposited in the
warehouses of Lower California, to be transferred to
the ports of Mexico at such times and in such quantities
as the demands of the market may require. In
the present variable state of Mexican trade, resulting
from an irregular and fluctuating tariff, which differs
for each port and changes with every change of
general or state administration, it is frequently necessary
to transfer vessels with their cargoes from one
port to another, or to keep them for weeks at sea,
standing off and on, so as to enable the agents to
arrange the rate of duties at the custom-house before
landing the cargoes. Sometimes the consignees are
obliged to send their vessels to the Sandwich islands
or Valparaiso until a change of administration will
enable them to avoid the exorbitant demands of some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">419</a></span>
petty governor or collector of customs. Moreover,
the principal commercial ports of this coast (Mazatlan
and San Blas) are inaccessible to merchant vessels for
four months of each year, and during that time are
visited only by small coasters. But, with Lower
California in our possession, merchant vessels of
whatever character, at all seasons and in all winds,
can find a refuge in La Paz, and their cargoes
despatched in such quantities and to such points of
the opposite coast as circumstances may justify. This
place in a few years will be what Mazatlan now is,
and Mazatlan experience the fate of San Blas and
Acapulco.</p>

<p>The importance, however, of this port results mainly
from its geographical position, and the influence it
is likely to exert as a military and naval depot upon
our commercial interests in the Pacific. The port of
San Francisco, in Upper California, should be well
fortified, and every care taken to make it a harbor
of refuge for our merchant and military marine, in
case of a maritime war; but it must be remembered
that that place is nearly fifteen hundred miles from
the nearest port of Mexico, and that it is very far
north of some of the best whaling grounds in the Pacific,
and too distant to afford much protection to our
commerce with Central America, although its position
gives it a controlling influence over the commerce of
Sandwich Islands, Upper California, and Oregon.
In the same way a well-fortified naval station at La
Paz, from its immediate proximity to the coast of
Mexico, would have a most beneficial influence on our
commercial and whaling interest in this part of the
Pacific. The great value, in time of maritime war,
of such <i>key</i> points as La Paz, and the commanding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">420</a></span>
influence exercised by them in the protection of commerce,
have become settled principles in military
defence; and England shows her appreciation of their
truth, and the wisdom of her own policy, in establishing
stations and points like St. Helena, Cape of Good
Hope, Gibraltar, Malta, Corfu, and Bermuda.</p>

<p>Again, the growing commerce of California and
Oregon, and the political importance of our possessions
on the Pacific, render it necessary that we should
have some means of rapid communication between
them and the seat of government at Washington.
This communication must be effected by the isthmus
of Panama or of Tehuantepec. In either case steamers
bound to Upper California and the Columbia River
must have one or more intermediate depots of fuel;
and in time of war it is important that these depots
be established in our own rather than in a hostile territory.
A glance at the map will show that La Paz
is nearly equidistant from the extremities of this line;
and that Tehuantepec, La Paz, and San Francisco
divide into four equal parts the whole distance from
Panama to Oregon. Moreover, as this ocean is peculiarly
suited to steam navigation, a large part of the
commerce of the Pacific must eventually be carried on
in steam vessels; and in all probability not many
years will elapse before a portion of our naval force in
these waters is of the same character. Under this
supposition, the importance of our possessing some
naval depot and harbor of refuge and repair south of
Upper California is too manifest to require argument
or illustration.</p>

<p>But whatever may be thought of the value of this
peninsula or of the gulf as a natural boundary between
us and Mexico, instead of an imaginary line drawn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">421</a></span>
from the Colorado to the Pacific, thus separating a
kindred people, and exposing the governments of the
two territories to continual collisions, the propriety of
retaining Lower California is, in my opinion, now no
longer an open question. When this country was first
taken possession of by the forces of the United States,
the people were promised the protection of our government
against Mexico, and guarantied the rights secured
by our Constitution; and in November, 1847, they
were assured by the commander-in-chief of the Pacific
squadron, (with the approbation of the Secretary
of the Navy,) that this territory would be <i>permanently</i>
retained by the American government; and again,
by the President of the United States, in his annual
message of December, 1847, that it "should never
be given up to Mexico." Acting under these assurances,
all the most respectable people of the territory
not only refused to take part with the Mexican forces
which were sent to attempt the recapture of that country
from the Americans, but many of them actually took
up arms in our defence, and rendered most valuable
services in ridding the peninsula of the guerrilla hordes
sent over from Mexico for the purpose of effecting
our expulsion. In this conflict, some who thus sided
with us lost their lives, many their property, and all
have exposed themselves to the vengeance of the
Mexican government. But these losses and dangers
they have willingly encountered, in the hope of obtaining
the better government of the United States.
They have regarded these promises as made in good
faith, and have been guided in their conduct by the
assurances thus held out to them by the agents of the
American government; and now, for the United
States to voluntarily surrender this country to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">422</a></span>
republic of Mexico, and leave these Californians exposed
to the loss of life and confiscation of property
for having sided with us, under the assurances thus
held out to them, would not only be in itself a breach
of national faith, but would make us appear in the
eyes of the world guilty of the most deliberate and
cruel deception.</p>

an interesting account of the origin and meaning of the names of
places in the new State. We have elsewhere alluded to the name
California, as being derived from <i>caliente</i> and <i>fornalla</i>, two Spanish
words, together signifying <i>hot furnace</i>.</p>

<p class="footnote"><i>Pueblo de los Angeles&mdash;City of the Angels.</i> So named from the fertility
of the soil, the geniality of the climate, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="footnote">San Diego, Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo, Santa Clara, Santa
Cruz, San Francisco, were all originally Catholic missionary stations
and were so named by the priests.</p>

<p class="footnote"><i>Monterey</i> signifies literally king of forests, and was so called in
honor of Count Monterey, as well as from the neighboring forest of
massive pines and other trees.</p>

<p class="footnote"><i>Contra Costa</i>, the name of a county, signifies opposite coast, from
its being opposite San Francisco. <i>Mount Diablo</i>, which is in this
county, was named from the following circumstance:</p>

<p class="footnote">In 1806 a military expedition from San Francisco marched against
the tribe "Bolgones," who were encamped at the foot of the mount;
the Indians were prepared to receive the expedition, and a hot engagement
ensued in the large hollow fronting the western side of the
mount. As the victory was about to be decided in favor of the Indians,
an unknown personage, decorated with the most extraordinary plumage,
and making divers movements, suddenly appeared near the
combatants. The Indians were victorious, and the incognitio (Puy)
departed toward the mount. The defeated soldiers, on ascertaining
that the spirit went through the same ceremony daily and at all hours,
named the mount "Diablo," in allusion to its mysterious inhabitant,
that continued thus to make his strange appearance, until the tribe
was subdued by the troops in command of Lieutenant Gabriel Moraga,
in a second campaign of the same year. In the aboriginal
tongue "Puy" signifies "Evil Spirit;" in Spanish it means Diablo,
and Devil in the Anglo-American language.</p>

<p class="footnote"><i>Calaveras</i> signifies skulls, and the creek thus styled was named from
the fact of three thousand skulls having been found lying on its banks
by its early discoverers. They were the remnants of a great battle between
the Indians.</p>

<p class="footnote"><i>Tuolumne</i>, which has been spelt so many different ways in the
letters from California, is a corruption of the Indian word "talmalamme,"
a cluster of stone wigwams.</p>

<p class="footnote"><i>Mariposa</i> means butterfly. The river was so named in 1807, by a
hunting party of Californians, from the fact of their encampment
there having been surrounded by myriads of most gorgeous butterflies.</p>

<p class="footnote"><i>Solano</i> was so named after a celebrated Catholic missionary.</p>

<p class="footnote"><i>Yolo</i> is a corruption of the Indian word "Yoloy," and means a place
abounding with rushes.</p>

<p class="footnote"><i>Marin</i> was so designated after a great Indian chief, who made war
so desperately against the Spaniards.</p>

<p class="footnote"><i>Sonoma</i> is an Indian word, signifying valley of the moon. The Indians
so named the valley in which the present town of that title is
situated.</p>

<p class="footnote"><i>Napa</i> was the name of the Indian tribe who inhabited the valley
of the same name.</p>

<p class="footnote"><i>Mendocino</i> was so named after the first Viceroy of Mexico.</p>

<p class="footnote"><i>Yuba</i>, a corruption of "uba," originally alluded to the immense
quantities of vines which shaded the river.</p>

<p class="footnote"><i>Butte</i> is a French word signifying hill, and was given by a party
of hunters from the Hudson Bay Company to a range of high hills
in the valley of the Sacramento. From thence the county is named.</p>

<p class="footnote"><i>Coluse</i> county was so called after an Indian tribe of which it was
the name.</p>

<p class="footnote"><i>Shalta</i> county is so styled after an Indian tribe also.</p>
